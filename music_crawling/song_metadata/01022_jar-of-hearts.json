  "lyrics": "Hợp âm viết ở tone - Tone gốc D#: Capo 1 1. No, I can't take one more step towards you ‘Cause all that's waiting is regret And don't you know I'm not your ghost anymore You lost the love I loved the most. I learned to live, half a- live And now you want me one more time. Who do you think you are Runnin' 'round leaving scars Collecting your jar of hearts And tearing love apart You're gonna catch a cold From the ice inside your soul So don't come back for me Who do you think you are? 2. I hear you're asking all around If I am anywhere to be found But I have grown too strong To ever fall back in your arms. I've learned to live, half a- live And now you want me one more time. It took so long just to feel al- right Remember how to put back the light in my eyes I wish I had missed the first time that we kissed ‘Cause you broke all your promises And now you're back You don't get to get me back."
