  "lyrics": "I wake up cold. Turn around. You ‘re still asleep. I dreamt that we belonged like this. Side by side a silent kiss. But who am I fooling. A -fraid to see. We’re meant to be. It’s a venture. My innocence leaves no room. For feelings that I have to prove........... Angels are crying. And so is my heart. When the moment comes . And you feel alone. Then you try to remember what went wrong .......... Then you realize ......... It’s too late to cry. Spread your wings and learn to fly. Instead you take what you can find. Another night with steamed -up lies. She knows in the morning ............ That you will be gone.........."
