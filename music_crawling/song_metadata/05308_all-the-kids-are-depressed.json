  "lyrics": "Tone How long have you been smiling? It seems like it's been too l ong Some days I don't feel like trying So what the fuck are you on? I think too much , we drink too much Falling in love like it's just nothing I want to know where do we go When nothing's wrong 'Cause all the kids are depressed Nothing ever makes sense I'm not feeling alright Staying up 'til sunrise And hoping shit is okay Pretending we know things I don't know what happened My natural reaction is that we're scared  So I guess we're scared   But I can't really keep lying 'Cause I've been scared all along Getting sick of sleeping in While all my friends are popping pills And I don't think that they're wrong I won't deny it 'cause you stole all the words I can't deny it if you won't give a fuck So I'll start it out You know I am so in love"
