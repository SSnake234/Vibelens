  "lyrics": "Tone Found myself tied and bounded In this beautiful garden Alone and disheartened Hmmm I saw you making your way through the trees Can you tell me your name please? Do you have a place to be? Oh could you tell me? Hmmm I wish that you could be right next to me And I know my heart beats When I am feeling all you heat Radiating over me I want to hold your hand But this is my fate Don’t smile on me light on me Don’t call my name cause I don’t wanna fall at all Please don’t make me put up all these walls You know that I can’t Show you me give you me Once again I put on a mask so you won’t see How devastating I am underneath But I still want you In this garden of ours Saw a beautiful flower I wanted to give ya Hmmm Once I am brave enough to take off this mask But I know I must hide Can’t show you who I really am Afraid that you won’t understand How bad I am inside Now I’m torn apart Will you fade? I’m so afraid That you will leave me once more in the very end So I’ll put on a mask to see you again All that I can do And live my life the way you wanted me to But I still want you ~ ~ I still want you ~ ~ And maybe back then Even if the chance was slim If I was brave enough to show you who I am Would everything be different once again? I’m drowning in tears Recklessly helplessly Looking at the broken mask in front of me I’m all alone fallen in defeat And I still want you ~ ~ But I still want you ~ ~ But I still want you ~ ~ I still want you"
