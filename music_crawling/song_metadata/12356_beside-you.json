  "lyrics": "Even if you were upside-down, I would be beside you, 1. And your world were a strange thing found, I would be beside you, In my symbolised world I'm a beautiful girl, In my house on the hill There is room for you still 2. When there's nothing but dark and sound, I will be beside you, When there's nothing but the long way 'round, I will be beside you, In my simplified world, We're a boy and a girl, In my house on the hill There is room for you still, (Refrain) I'll be everywhere you go, you go, you go, I'll be everywhere you go, you go, you go... In my symbolised world I'm a beautiful girl, In my house on the hill there is room for you still. 3. When there's nothing but roaring sound, I will be beside you, When there's nothing but the long drop down, I will be beside you, When your fears are a swarm in the hive of your mind, When the tears of your love and your loss are en twined...        I'll be everywhere you go, you go, you go, I'll be everywhere you go, you go, you go."
