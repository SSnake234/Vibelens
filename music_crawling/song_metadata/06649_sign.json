My love is so wild Please give me a sign My love is so wild Please give me, baby My love is so wild Please give me a sign My love is so wild Please give me a sign  x4 Fading in the dark All the lights Go down I'm feeling high and drunk Close my eyes And I can't stop Thinking of you Walking on a lonely avenue Are you? Are you? Are you? My love is so wild Please give me a sign My love is so wild Please give me, baby My love is so wild Please give me a sign My love is so wild Please give me a sign My love is so wild Please give me a sign My love is so wild Please give me, baby My love is so wild Please give me a sign My love is so wild Please give me a sign"
