  "lyrics": "I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath Scared to rock the boat and make a mess So I sat quietly, agree politely I guess that I forgot I had a choice I let you push me past the breaking point I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything You held me down but I got up (hey!) Already brushing off the dust You hear my voice, you hear that sound Like thunder gonna’ shake the crowd You held me down but I got up (hey!) Get ready cos’ I’ve had enough I see it all, I see it now I got the eye of the ti--ger, the fighter, dancing through the fi--re Cos’ I am a champion, and you’re gonna’ hear me roar Louder, louder than a lion, cos’ I am a champion And you’re gonna’ hear me roar (oh oh oh) You’re gonna’ hear me roar Now I’m floating like a butterfly, stinging like a bee, I earned my stripe I went from zero, to my own hero You held me down but I got up You held me down but I got up (hey!) Already brushing off the dust You hear my voice, you hear that sound Like thunder gonna’ shake the crowd You held me down but I got up (hey!) Get ready cos’ I’ve had enough I see it all, I see it now I got the eye of the ti--ger, the fighter, dancing through the fi--re Cos’ I am a champion, and you’re gonna’ hear me roar Louder, louder than a lion, cos’ I am a champion And you’re gonna’ hear me roar (oh oh oh) You’re gonna’ hear me roar (oh oh oh) You’re gonna’ hear me roar Roar, roar, roar, roar, roaaaar! I got the eye of the ti--ger, the fighter, dancing through the fi--re Cos’ I am a champion, and you’re gonna’ hear me roar Louder, louder than a lion, cos’ I am a champion And you’re gonna’ hear me roar (oh oh oh) You’re gonna’ hear me roar"
