  "lyrics": "   I walk though the valley of the shadow of death And I feel no evil because I'm blind to it all And my mind and my gun they comfort me Because I know I'll kill my enemies when they come Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell on this earth forevermore. Said I walk beside the still waters and they restore my soul. But I can't walk on the path of the right because I am wrong Well, I came upon a man at the top of the hill called himself the savior of the human race said he come to save the world from destruction and pain but I said, \"how can you save the world from itself?\"   'Cause I walk through the valley of the shadow of death and I fear no evil 'cause I'm blind. Oh, and I walk beside the still waters and they restore my soul, but I know when I die my soul is damned."
