Baby, baby, try to find (Hey, hey, hey!) A little time and I'll make you mine I'll be home I'll be beside the phone waiting for you Ooo-oo-ooo, ooo-oo-ooo Why do you build me up (build me up) Buttercup, baby Just to let me down (let me down) and mess me around And then worst of all (worst of all) you never call, baby When you say you will (say you will) but I love you still I need you (I need you) more than anyone, darlin' You know that I have from the start So build me up (build me up) Buttercup, Don't break my heart  To you I'm a toy but I could be the boy you Adore, if you'd just let me know Although you're untrue, I'm attracted to you all the more Why do I need you so (Hey, hey, hey!) Baby, baby, try to find (Hey, hey, hey!) A little time and I'll make you mine I'll be home I'll be beside the phone waiting for you Ooo-oo-ooo, ooo-oo-ooo Why do you build me up (build me up) Buttercup, baby Just to let me down (let me down) and mess me around And then worst of all (worst of all) you never call, baby When you say you will (say you will) but I love you still I need you (I need you) more than anyone, darlin' You know that I have from the start So build me up (build me up) Buttercup Don't break my heart "
