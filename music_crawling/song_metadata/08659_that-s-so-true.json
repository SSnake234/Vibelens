  "lyrics": "I could go and read your mind Think about your dumb face all the time Living in your glass house, I'm outside Mm, looking into big blue eyes Did it just to hurt me, make me cry Smiling through it all, yeah, that's my life You're an idiot Now I’m positive I should go and warn her Ooh Bet you’re thinking she’s so cool Kicking back on your couch, making eyes from across the room Wait, I think I’ve been there too Ooh What’d she do to get you off? Taking down her hair like “Oh my god” Taking off your shirt, I did that once or twice Uh, No, I know, and I’ll fuck off But I think I like her, she’s so fun! Wait, I think I hate her, I’m not that evolved I’m sorry she’s missing it Not my business But I had to warn ya Ooh Bet you’re thinking she’s so cool Kicking back on your couch, making eyes from across the room Wait, I think I’ve been there too Ooh You’ve got me thinking she’s so cool But I know what I know and you’re just another dude Ooh, ooh that’s so true Made it out alive, but I think I lost it Remember how I died when you started walking That’s my life, that’s my life I’ll put up a fight, taking out my earrings You should spend the night, catch me on your ceiling That’s your prize, that’s your prize, well Mmm You’ve got me thinking she’s so cool Kicking back on your couch, making eyes from across the room Wait, I think I’ve been there too Ooh, Oh, Ooh You’ve got me thinking she’s so cool But I know what I know and you’re just another dude Ooh, that’s so true"
