I hope you know, I hope you know That this has nothing to do with you It's personal, Myself and I We've got some straightenin' out to do And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket. But Ive got to get a move on with my life Its time to be a big girl now (hold)and big girls don't cry. Don't cry, (likeDon't cry, intro)Don't cry Like the little schoolmate in the school yard We'll play jacks and uno cards I'll be your best friend and you'll be mine, Valentine Yes, you can hold my hand if you want to 'Cause I want to hold yours too We'll be playmates and lovers and share our secret worlds But it's time for me to go home It's getting late, dark outside I need to be with myself instead of clarity, peace, serenity Don't cry, (likeDon't cry, intro)Don't cry"
