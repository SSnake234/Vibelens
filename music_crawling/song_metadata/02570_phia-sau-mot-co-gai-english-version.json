Besided you and hear you talk about him with the twinkle eyes I feel like you're avoiding me It's seem like you always understand me Can't interfere , And can't let you to see my tears So i step back to behind , To see you clearer For watching you from afar , More tender My world is getting smaller just by a girl Or i will keep silently inside you No matter if we can't walk together And from there my eyes can feel sereni ty There's no one could stop the heart when it just fall in love Please dont tell me that i have to give up I love her..... That's enough Eve ryone wishes to be in love I've waited over time to meet and see her off Open my eyes... I can see her smile in the sunshine . So i step back to behind , To see you clearer For watching you from afar , More tender My world is getting smaller just by a girl Or i will keep silently inside you No matter if we can't walk together And from there my eyes can feel sereni ty"
