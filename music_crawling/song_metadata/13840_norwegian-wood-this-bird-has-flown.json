  "lyrics": "I once had a girl, or should I say she once had me. Norwegian wood. She asked my to stay and told me to sit anywhere, So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a  chair. I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine. It's time for bed. She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh, I told her I didn't, and crawled off to sleep in the  bath. And when I awoke, I was alone, this bird has flown. Norwegian   wood."
