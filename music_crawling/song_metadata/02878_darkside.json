  "lyrics": "We're not in love We share no stories Just something in your eyes Don't be afraid The shadows know me Let's leave the world be hind Take me through the night Fall into the darkside We don't need the light We'll live on the darkside I see it, let's feel it While we're still young and fearless Let go of the light Fall into the darkside Fall into the darkside  Give into the darkside  Let go of the light Fall into the darkside Beneath the sky It's black as diamonds We're running out of time Don't wait for truth To come and blind us Let's just believe their lies Believe it, I see it I know that you can feel it No secrets worth keeping So fool me like I'm dreaming"
