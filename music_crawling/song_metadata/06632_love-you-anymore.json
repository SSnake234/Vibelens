  "lyrics": "Just because I wander 'round the places we would go Hoping that I'd run into you one last time Just because I never took your picture off my phone Doesn't mean that you're still on my mind Just because I accidentally slipped and said your name Well I heard your song, it makes me inse cure Just because I know I'll never ever feel the same Doesn't mean I love you any more Am I lying to my self again When I say you're not the best I've ever had Am I lying to my self again When I say that I'm not missing you so bad Just because I'm on my knees and swearing I would change And I'd do anything to hear you say \"I'm yours\" Just because I know I'll never ever feel the same Doesn't mean I love you any more"
