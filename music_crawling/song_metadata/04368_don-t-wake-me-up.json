  "lyrics": "Too much light in this window, don't wake me up Only coffee no sugar, inside my cup If I wake and you're here still, give me a kiss I wasn't finished dreaming, about your lips Don't wake me up, up, up, up up, up Don't wake me up, up, up, up up, up Don't wake me up, up, up, up up, up Don't wake me up Don't wake me.. Don't wake me  up.......... Don't wake me  up.......... Don't wake me  up.......... yeaha Don't wake me up, up, up, up, up, up Don't wake me up Don't wake me.. So much life in the city, you won't believe Been awake for some days now, no time to sleep If your heart is a pillow, this love's the bed Tell me what is the music, inside my head I don't wanna fall, fall, fall, fall asleep no, I don't wanna fall unless I'm falling for you"
