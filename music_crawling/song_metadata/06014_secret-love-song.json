  "lyrics": "tone gốc : A capo 2 chơi When you hold me in the street And you kiss me on the dance floor I wish that it could be like that Why can't it be like that? Cause I'm yours We keep behind closed doors Every time I see you, I die a little more Stolen moments that we steal as the curtain falls It'll never be e- nough It's ob- vious you're meant for me Every piece of you, it just fits perfectly Every second, every thought, I'm in so deep But I'll never show it on my face But we know this, we got a love that is home- less Why can't I hold you in the street? Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor? I wish that it could be like that Why can't it be like that? Cause I'm yours When you're with him, do you call his name Like you do when you're with me? Does it feel the same? Would you leave if I was ready to settle down? Or would you play it safe and stay? Girl you know this We got a love that is hope- less Chorus: Why can't I hold you in the street? Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor? I wish that it could be like that Why can't it be like that? Cause I'm yours And nobody knows I'm in love with someone's baby I don't wanna hide us a- way Tell the world about the love we making I'm living for that day Someday When you hold me in the street And you kiss me on the dance floor I wish that it could be like that Why can't it be like that? Cause I'm yours Chorus: Why can't I hold you in the street? Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor? I wish that it could be like that Why can't it be like that? Cause I'm yours Why can't I say that I'm in love? I wanna shout it from the rooftops I wish that it could be like that Why can't we be like that? Cause I'm yours Why can't we be like that? Wish we could be like that."
