You cover your wounds, but underneath them A million voices in your head that whisper, \" Stop, now\" Another twist of the knife, turn of the screws It's all in your mind and it's fighting you Arm yourself, a storm is coming What you gonna do now? It's your re flection looking back to pull you down So are you gonna die today or make it out alive? You gotta conquer the monster in your head and then you'll fly Fly, Phoenix, fly It's time for a new empire Go bury your demons then tear down the ceiling Phoenix, fly And now you're playing with matches, come out of the ashes Under neath you, a million voi ces in the crowd they're screaming, \" Stop, now\" Well let 'em swallow their pride, you're turning the tide to true be lievers Got them in the palm of your hand, you're playing God now What you gonna do now? It's your re flection looking back to pull you down So are you gonna die today or make it out alive? You gotta conquer the monster in your head and then you'll fly Fly, Phoenix, fly It's time for a new empire Go bury your demons then tear down the ceiling Phoenix, fly"
