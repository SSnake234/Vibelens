  "lyrics": "In the heat of the moment When you’re all a lone and out of breath What’s keeping you going? What do you see up in your head? When your eyes are closing Where do you wish you were instead? You got me hanging by a thread Yeah.. Oh tell me now Who’s the one that takes you higher than Than you’ve ever been? Baby I just gotta know the answer Who’s the one you think of night and day? Ain’t no time to waste. I’m just tryna say Who do you love? Is it him or me? Cause I can’t take the pressure any more Who do you love? Girl it’s killing me If you can’t say that I’m the one for sure Then I’m walking out the door Imma need me a new thang Can't believe this boo thang Now the beef cookin like Gordon Ram say We should be somewhere that’s hot and san dy We used to post up in NY like Marcus Camp bell My two things fighting like Monica and Bran dy They ask me who you love like Cool J 80’s baby down. Middle like Katy And what that’s my Other lady Them boys is next. Mon tana, Monsta X Who do you love? Is it him or me? Cause I can’t take the pressure any more Who do you love? Girl it’s killing me If you can’t say that I’m the one for sure Who do you love? Who do you love? Who do you love? (Said who do you love) Who do you love? Who do you love? Who do you love? Oooooo Who’s the one that takes you higher than Than you’ve ever been? Who’s the one you think of night and day? Ain’t no time to waste. I’m just tryna say Who do you love? Is it him or me? Cause I can’t take the pressure any more Who do you love? Girl it’s killing me If you can’t say that I’m the one for sure Who do you love? Who do you love? Who do you love? (Said who do you love) Who do you love? Who do you love? Who do you love? Oooooo"
