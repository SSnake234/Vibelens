Could it shine down here with you? 'Cause my love is mine, all mine I love, my, my, mine Nothing in the world belongs to me But my love, mine, all mine, all mine My baby here on Earth showed me what my heart was worth So, when it comes to be my turn. Could you shine it down here for her? 'Cause my love is mine, all mine I love, my, my, mine Nothing in the world be longs to me But my love, mine, all mine Nothing in the world is mine for free But my love, mine, all mine, all mine"
