  "lyrics": "Summer after high school when we first met We make out in you mustang to radio head And on my 18th birthday we bought matching tattoos Used to steal your parent's liquor and climb to the roof Talk about our future like we had a clue Never planned that one day i'd be losing you In another life I would be your girl We keep all our promises be us against the world In another life I would make you stay So I don't have to say you were the one that got away The one that got away. I was June you were my johnny cash Never one without the other we made a pact Sometimes when I miss you I put those records on Someone said you had your tattoo removed Saw you down town singin the blues It's time to face the music i'm no longer your muse But in another life I would be your girl We keep all our promises be us against the world In another life I would make you stay So I don't have to say you were the one that got away The one that got away. The one the one the one The one that got away. All his money can't buy me a time machine. no Can't replace you with a million rings. no I shoulda told you what you meant to me. woe Cause now I pay the price. In another life I would be your girl We keep all our promises be us against the world In another life I would make you stay So I don't have to say you were the one that got away The one that got away The one, the one In another life I would make you stay So I don't have to say you were the one that got away The one that got away"
