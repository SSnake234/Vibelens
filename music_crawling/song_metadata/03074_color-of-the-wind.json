  "lyrics": "You think you own what ever land you land on the earth is just a dead thing you can claim but I know every rock and tree and creature has a life, has a spirt, has a name you think the only people who are people are the people who look and think like you but if you walk the footsteps of a stranger you'll learn things you never knew never knew have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon or ask the grinning bobcat why he grins can you sing with all the voices of the mountain can you paint with all the colors of the wind can you paint with all the colors of the wind how high does the Sickamore grow? if you cut it down then you'll never know"
