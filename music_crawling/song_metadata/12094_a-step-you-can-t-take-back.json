  "lyrics": " x2 So you find yourself at the subway With your world in a bag by your side And all at once what seemed like a good way You realize is the end of the line For what it's worth Here comes the track There goes to black Are you ready for the take a step You can't take back   Taken all the punches you could take Took them all right on the the chin And though the camel's back is breaking Again again for what it's worth Here comes the track There goes the pain It cuts to black Are you ready for the take a step You can't take back  Did she love you? Did she take you down? Was she on her knees when she kissed your crown? Tell me what you found Here comes the rain So hold your hat And don't pray to god Cause he won't talk back Are you ready for the last act To take a step You can't take back back back You cant take back back back So you find yourself at the subway With your world in a bag by your side"
