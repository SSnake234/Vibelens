  "lyrics": "  ....I met you in the dark ...you lit me up ...you made me feel as though ..i was enough ....we danced the night away ...we drank too much ...i held your hair back when ....you were throwing up .....And then you smiled over your shoulder ..for a minute i was stone cold sober ...i pulled you closer to my .. chest ..And then you asked me to stay over ..i said i already told you ....i think that you should get some.. ..rest ...I knew i loved you then ...but you'll never know ...cause i played it cool when i ...was scared of letting go ...I knew i needed you ....but i've never shown ....and i wanna stay with you until we're grey and old just say you wont let go ... just say you wont let go .... ...I wake you up with some ...breakfast in bed ...I'll bring you coffee ...and kiss on your head ...I'll take the kids to school ...wave them goodbye ...and i'll thank my lucky stars ...for that night ....when you looked over your shoulder ....for a minute i forget that i'm older ...i wanna dance with you right .. ..now ...and you look is beautiful as ever ...and i swear that everyday you'll get better ....you make me feel this way somehow ...Im so in love with you ...and i hope you know ...darling your love is more than its worth in gold ..we've come so far my dear ...look how we've grown ...i want to stay with you until we're grey and old just say you wont let go.. just say you wont let go.. ...I wanna live with you ...even when we're ghost ....cause you were always there for me when i needed you most ...cause im gonna love you till ...my lungs give up ...i promise you death will part like in our vows ...So i wrote this song for you ....now everybody knows ....cause its just you and me until we're grey and old just say you wont let go.. just say you wont let go.. just say you wont let go.. just say you wont let go .."
