  "lyrics": "Intro: , , , There's a place we know What's cold enough won't grow We have seen the dark And the darkness took it's toll And the journey waits for no one If no one breaks the mould And our hearts are stronger than we know  (x2) That you and I could learn to love again After all this time Maybe that is how I knew you were the one That you could still believe in me again After all our trials Maybe that is how I knew you were the one To awake and know We made it through the storm And someone saves their sweet embrace For you and you alone     That you and I could learn to love again After all this time Maybe that is how I knew you were the one That you could still believe in me again After all our trials Maybe that is how I knew you were the one Ohhh   Silence says we remember We remember Two lost souls in the shadow In the shadows That is how I knew you were the one And that is how I knew you were the one"
