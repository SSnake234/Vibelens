Baby, it hurts When the sun goes down and the band won't play I'll always re member us this way Lovers in the night poets trying to write We don't know how to rhyme but damn we try But all I really know you're where I wanna go The part of me that's you will never die When I'm all choked up and I can't find the words Every time we say goodbye. Baby, it hurts So when the sun goes down and the band won't play I'll always re member us this way I don't wanna be just a memory, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh baby, yeah When I'm all choked up and I can't find the words Every time we say goodbye. Baby, it hurts So when the sun goes down and the band won't play I'll always re member us this way oh, yeah When you look at me And the whole world fades I'll always re member us this way"
