'Cause I'm 'bout to make a scene Double up that sunscreen I'm 'bout to turn the heat up Gonna make your glasses steam Ooh, tell me whatcha, whatcha, what you gon' do, ooh? When I do my walk, walk I can guarantee your jaw will drop, drop 'Cause they don't make a lot of what I got, got Ladies if you feel me, this your bop, bop (Bop bop, bop) I could have my Gucci on I could wear my Louis Vuitt on But even with nothin' on Bet, I made you look (I made you look) Yeah, I look good in my Ver sace dress (Take it off) But I'm hotter when my morning hair's a mess But even with my hoodie on Bet, I made you look (I made you look) (Mhmm) And once you get a taste You'll never be the same This ain't that ordinary It's that fourteen karat cake Ooh, tell me whatcha, whatcha, what you gon' do, ooh? When I do my walk, walk I can guarantee your jaw will drop, drop 'Cause they don't make a lot of what I got, got Ladies if you feel me, this your bop, bop (Bop bop, bop) I could have my Gucci on I could wear my Louis Vuitt on But even with nothin' on Bet, I made you look (I made you look) Yeah, I look good in my Ver sace dress (Take it off) But I'm hotter when my morning hair's a mess But even with my hoodie on Bet, I made you look (I made you look)"
