  "lyrics": "Something must've gone wrong in my brain Got your chemicals all in my veins Feeling all the highs, feeling all the pain Let go of the way I used to fall in lane Now I’m seeing red, not thinking straight Blurring all the lines, you intoxicate me Just like nicotine Nicotine, morphine Suddenly, I’m a fiend and you’re all I need All I need It’s you, babe And I’m a sucker for the way that you move babe And I could try to run but it would be useless Just one hit, you will know I’ll never be the same It’s you, babe And I’m a sucker for the way that you move babe And I could try to run but it would be useless Just one hit, you will know I’ll never ever ever be the same I’ll never be the same I’ll never be the same I’ll never be the same Sneaking in LA when the lights are low Off of one touch, I could overdose It’s something I’ve saved, girl I wanna see you lose control Just like nicotine Nicotine, morphine Suddenly, I’m a fiend and you’re all I need All I need It’s you, babe And I’m a sucker for the way that you move babe And I could try to run but it would be useless Just one hit, you will know I’ll never be the same It’s you, babe And I’m a sucker for the way that you move babe And I could try to run but it would be useless Just one hit, you will know I’ll never ever ever be the same I’ll never be the same I’ll never be the same I’ll never be the same You're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my head You're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my head It’s you, babe And I’m a sucker for the way that you move babe And I could try to run but it would be useless Just one hit, you will know I’ll never be the same It’s you, babe And I’m a sucker for the way that you move babe And I could try to run but it would be useless Just one hit, you will know I’ll never ever ever be the same"
