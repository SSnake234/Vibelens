  "lyrics": "tone    I see the crystal raindrops fall, and the beauty of it all Is when the sun comes shining through To make those rainbows in my mind, When I think of you sometime, And I want to spend some time with you. Just the two of us, we can make it if we try, Just the two of us, just the two of us. Just the two of us, building castles in the sky, Just the two of us, you and I. We look for love, no time for tears, wasted water's all that is, And it don't make no flowers grow. Good things might come to those who wait, But not for those who wait too late We've got to go for all we know. Just the two of us, we can make it if we try, Just the two of us, just the two of us. Just the two of us, building castles in the sky, Just the two of us, you and I.            I hear the crystal raindrops fall on the window down the hall And it becomes the morning dew. And Darling, when the morning comes And I see the morning sun, I want to be the one with you. Just the two of us, we can make it if we try, Just the two of us, just the two of us. Just the two of us, building castles in the sky, Just the two of us, you and I."
