Painter baby you could be the muse I'm the reporter, baby you could be the news 'Cause you're the cigarette and I'm the smoker We raise abet, cause you're the joker Truth though , you are the chalk and I could be the blackboard And you can be the talk and I could be the walk Even when the sun don't shine I got faith in you and I So put your pretty little hands in mine Even when we're down to the wire babe Even when it's do or die We can do it baby simple and plain Cause this love is a sure thing You could bet that, never got to sweat that You could bet that, never got to sweat that, that, that You could be the lover I'll be the fighter babe If I'm the blunt, you could be the lighter babe, fire it up! Writer babe, you could be the quote If I'm the lyric baby you could be the note, record that! Saint, I'm a sinner, prize, I'm a winner, and it's you Paper baby, I'll be the pen Say that I'm the one, cause you are ten (Real and not pretend) Even when the sun don't shine I got faith in you and I So put your pretty lil hands in mine Even when we're down to the wire babe Even when it's do or die We can do it babe simple and plain Cause this love is a sure thing Rock with me baby Let me hold you in my arms Rock with me baby Let me hold you in my arms I fall in love every single time I look into your eyes I can tell your mine I get mad thinking how I can't always have you around I wanna make you spend the whole day with me boy Play me like your toy, I'm all yours to enjoy Hoping this moment lasts long and forever I got no fear what so ever, you're my one & only lover Roll a dice I bet it twice You in it you can bet that Ready or not, I'm gon' have you by tonight I call the shots won't you be my kryptonite Love you like a brother Treat you like a friend Respect you like a lover, Dm oh oh oh oh oh oh"
