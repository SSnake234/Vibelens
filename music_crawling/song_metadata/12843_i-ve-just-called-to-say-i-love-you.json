  "lyrics": "1. No new years day to cele- brate No chocolate covered candy hearts to give a way No first of spring, no song to sing In fact heres just another ordinary day No april rain no flowers bloom No wedding saturday within the month of june But what it is, is something true Made up of these three words that I must say to you Chorus: I just called to say I love you I just called to say how much I care I just called to say I love you And I mean it from the bottom of my heart 2. No summers high no warm July No harvest moon to light one tender August night No autumn breeze no falling leaves No even time for birds to fly to southern skies No libra sun no hallo- ween No giving thanks to all the christmas joy you bring But what it is though old so new To fill your heart like no three words could ever do Lên ½ tone --------- Chorus: I just called to say I love you I just called to say how much I care I just called to say I love you And I mean it from the bottom of my heart len tone Chorus: I just called to say I love you I just called to say how much I care I just called to say I love you And I mean it from the bottom of my heart."
