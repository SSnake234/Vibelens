Ba hama, bahama mama Got the biggest house in town bahama mama Bahama, bahama mama But her troubles getting down bahama mama The thing is each of them looks Like a gorgeous moviequeen Every one a perfect find And if a man refused that temptin scene He simply cant make up his mind. Ba hama, bahama mama You should all be looking for bahama mama Bahama, bahama mama And Im sure you will adore bahama mama."
