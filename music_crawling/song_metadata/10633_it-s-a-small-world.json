  "lyrics": "It's a world of laughter, a world of tears It's a world of hopes and a world of fears There's so much that we share that it's time we're aware It's a small world after all It's a small world after all It's a small world after all It's a small world after all It's a small, small world There is just one moon and one golden sun And a smile means friendship to everyone Though the mountains divide and the oceans are wide It's a small world after all It's a small world after all It's a small world after all It's a small world after all It's a small, small world"
