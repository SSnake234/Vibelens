  "lyrics": "[A]25 y y ea ea rs an d my life is still Trying to get up that great big hill of hope For a destination I realized quickly when I knew I should That the whole world's MADE UP OF this brotherhood of man FOR whatever that means And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed Just to get it all out, what's in my head And I, I am feeling a little peculiar And so I wake in the morning and I step outside And I take A deep breath and I get real high And I scream from the top of my lungs, What's goin' on And I say hey.... hey.... I said hey, what's goin' on And I say hey.... hey.... I said hey, what's goin' on (just repeat the chord pattern until the last part of this song)"
