  "lyrics": "tone    It was just like yesterday, When you chose to leave and I to stay It was a warm and sunny day But my heart felt as heavy as stone    Never told me where you went, Then again I never tried to ask Now I know in life you have one chance And you better use it well When the mountains fall and the oceans flood I'm still in search of you Only thing I want to say - I'm still in love with you        Finally I found your place, Sadly I came three summers late Now I am sitting by your grave And I sing this song for you When the mountains fall and the oceans flood I'm still in search of you Only thing I want to say - I'm still in love with you     One last thing I have to say - I'm still in love with you"
