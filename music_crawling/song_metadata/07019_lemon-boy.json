Oh well The whales start to beach themselves The tortoise shells tear away from their spines ..It happens all the time, ...it happens all the time Lemon Boy and I, we’re gonna live fore ver Like Snufkin and Little My, we’ll get a round where ver Lemon Boy and I, we’re gonna live fore ver Like Snufkin and Little My, we’ll get a round where ver It’s actually pretty easy being nice to a bitter boy like him 'Cause we're the bitterest boys in town Yeah, we’re the bitterest guys a round And I got my self a citrus friend"
