When you've been fighting for it all your life You've been struggling to make things right That's how a superhero learns to fly Every day, every hour turn the pain into power When you've been fighting for it all your life You've been working every day and night That's how a superhero learns to fly Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power - - - - - - When you've been fighting for it all your life You've been struggling to make things right That's how a superhero learns to fly"
