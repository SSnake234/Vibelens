Roman Cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror, my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I can't explain Once you go there was never never an honest word But that was when I ruled the world I used to rule the world. Seas would rise when I gave the word Now in the morning, I sleep a lone. Sweep the streets I used to own One minute I held the key next the walls were closed on me And I discovered that my castles stand Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing. Roman Cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror, my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I can't explain Once you go there was never never an honest word But that was when I ruled the world Oh-oh-oh-oh- oh. Oh-oh-oh-oh- oh Oh-oh-oh-oh- oh. Oh-oh-oh-oh- oh I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing. Roman Cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror, my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I can't explain Once you go there was never never an honest word But that was when I ruled the world"
