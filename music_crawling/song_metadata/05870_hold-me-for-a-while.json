Is it tears that I see? Oh to morrow you are gone ...So to morrow I'm a lone Short moments of time We have left to share our love Hold, hold me for a while I know this won't last fo rever So hold, hold me to night Be fore the morning takes you a way We're in each others arms Soon we're miles apart Can you i magine how I'll miss ...Your touch and your kiss ? Short moments of time We have left to share our love Hold, hold me for a while I know this won't last fo rever So hold, hold me to night Be fore the morning takes you a way What's that sparkle in your eyes? Is it tears that I see? Oh to morrow you are gone So to morrow I'm a lone Short moments of time We have left to share our love Hold, hold me for a while I know this won't last fo rever So hold, hold me to night Be fore the morning takes you a way ...Hold, hold me now From dusk all night to dawn ...Save, save me now A short moment of time Hold, hold me for a while I know this won't last fo rever So hold, hold me to night Be fore the morning takes you a way"
