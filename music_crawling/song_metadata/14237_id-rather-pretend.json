Will it even matter what you say? Can you make these feelings go away? Tell me, is this real to you? 'Cause I can feel my heart again You're so tempting but I'm scared so I'd rather pretend That I don't love you like I do 'Cause I don't wanna hurt again I wanna love you but I'm scared so I'd rather pretend I'd rather pretend I'd rather pretend, oh oh oh What if I'm at a loss Hoping you'll come back to me when you're gone? There's so many ways I've seen this going wrong So many ways I've seen this fall apart And I've seen all the signs What if they're all lies? Will it even matter what you say? Can you make these feelings go away? Tell me, is this real to you? 'Cause I can feel my heart again You're so tempting but I'm scared so I'd rather pretend That I don't love you like I do 'Cause I don't wanna hurt again I wanna love you but I'm scared so I'd rather pretend Pretend, pretend, oh  "
