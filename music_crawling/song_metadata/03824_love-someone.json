  "lyrics": "  There are days I wake up and I pinch myself You're with me, not someone else And I am scared, yeah, I'm still scared That it's all a dream. 'Cause you still look perfect as days go by Even the worst ones, you make me smile I'd stop the world if it gave us time 'Cause when you love someone You open up your heart When you love someone You make room If you love someone And you're not afraid to lose 'em You probably never loved some- one like I do You probably never loved some- one like I do uhh uhh When you say You love the way I make you feel Everything be- comes so real Don't be scared, no, don't be scared 'Cause you're all I need And you still look perfect as days go by Even the worst ones, you make me smile I'd stop the world if it gave us time 'Cause when you love someone You open up your heart When you love someone You make room If you love someone And you're not afraid to lose 'em You probably never loved some- one like I do You probably never loved some- one like I do uhh uhh All my life I thought it'd be hard to find The one 'til I found you And I find it bitterswe- et 'Cause you gave me something to lose But when you love someone You open up your heart When you love someone You make room If you love someone And you're not afraid to lose 'em You probably never loved some- one like I do You probably never loved some- one like I do You probably never loved some- one like I do"
