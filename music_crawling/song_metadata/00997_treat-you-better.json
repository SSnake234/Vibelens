  "lyrics": " I won't lie to you I know he's just not right for you And you can tell me if I'm off But I see it on your face When you say that he's the one that you want And you're spending all your time In this wrong situation And anytime you wanted to stop I know I can treat you better Than he can And any girl like you deserves a gentleman Tell me why are we wasting time On all on your wasted crying When you should be with me instead I know I can treat you better Better than he can I'll stop time for you The second you say you'd like me too I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing Baby, just to wake up with you Could be everything I need and this could be so different Tell me what you want to do 'Cause I know I can treat you better Than he can And any girl like you deserves a gentleman Tell me why are we wasting time On all on your wasted crying When you should be with me instead I know I can treat you better Better than he can Give me a sign Take my hand, we'll be fine Promise I won't let you down Just know that you don't Have to do this alone Promise I'll never let you down I know I can treat you better Than he can And any girl like you deserves a gentleman Tell me why are we wasting time On all on your wasted crying When you should be with me instead I know I can treat you better  Better than he can  Better than he can  Better than he can"
