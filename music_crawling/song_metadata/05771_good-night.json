Close your eyes and I'll close mine . Good night Sleep tight . Now the moon be gins to shine . Good night Sleep tight. . Dream sweet dreams for me. . Dream sweet dreams for you.. . Close your eyes and I'll close mine. . Good night Sleep tight.  . Now the sun turns out his light. . Good night Sleep tight. . Dream sweet dreams for me . . Dream sweet dreams for you.."
