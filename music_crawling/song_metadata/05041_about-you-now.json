  "lyrics": "It was so easy that night Should've been strong, yeah I lied Nobody gets me like you Couldn't keep hold of you then How could I know what you meant There was nothing to compare to I know everything changes All the cities and faces But I know how I feel about you There's a mountain between us But there's one thing I sure of That I know how I feel about you Can we bring yester day back around, Cos I know how I feel about you now, I was dumb, I was wrong, I let you down, But I know how I feel about you now All that it takes one more chance, Don't let our last kiss be our last, Give me to night and I'll show you I know everything changes, I don't care where it takes us, 'Cus I know how I feel about you Can we bring yester day back around, 'Cus I know how I feel about you now, I was dumb, I was wrong, I let you down, But I know how I feel about you now Not a day passed me by, Not a day passed me by, When I don't think about you, And there's no moving on, 'Cus I know your the one, And I can't be with out you Can we bring yester day back around, 'Cus I know how I feel about you now, I was dumb, I was wrong, I let you down, But I know how I feel about you now But I know how I feel about you now Yes I know how I feel about you now."
