  "lyrics": "Tone My winter nights are taken up by static Stress and holiday shopping traffic But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else Just like magic In my heart is a Christmas tree farm To dance under sparkling lights And I just wanna be there to night Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon Mistakes are forgiven And everythin' is icy and blue And you would be there too Under the mistletoe watchin' the fire glow And tellin' me, \" I love you\" Just bein' in your arms takes me back to that little farm Where every wish comes true In my heart is a Christmas tree farm We run inside out from the cold In the town, kids are dreamin' of sleighs They wake to see a blanket of snow Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon Mistakes are forgiven And everythin' is icy and blue And you would be there too Under the mistletoe watchin' the fire glow And tellin' me, \" I love you\" Just bein' in your arms takes me back to that little farm Where every wish comes true And when I'm feelin' a lone You remind me of home And when the world isn't fair I pretend that we're there Baby, baby, Merry Christmas ( To you) Under the mistletoe (To you) Watching the fire glow And tellin' me, \" I love you\" Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (Darling) Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas I love you Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (I just want you to know) Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas Where every wish comes true I love you"
