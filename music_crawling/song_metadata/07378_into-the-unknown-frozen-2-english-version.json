  "lyrics": "Tone I can hear you, but I won’t Some look for trouble, while others don’t There’s a thousand reasons I should go about my day And ignore your whispers which I wish would go away O- o You’re not a voice And if I heard you (which I don’t) Everyone I’ve loved is here within these walls I’m sorry, secret siren, But I’m blocking out your calls I’ve had my adventures, I don’t need something new I’m afraid of what I’m risking if I follow you. Into the un known… Into the un known… Into the un known! A-a-a-a What do you want Are you here to distract me Or are you someone out there Who’s a little bit like me Who knows deep down I’m not where I’m meant to be Every day is a little harder As I feel my power grows Don’t you know there’s part of me that longs to go Into the un known Into the un known! Into the un known!! A-a-a-a Are you out there? Can you feel me? A- a-a-a! A- a-a-a A- a-a-a! A- a-a-a Where are you going How do I follow you Into the unknown!"
