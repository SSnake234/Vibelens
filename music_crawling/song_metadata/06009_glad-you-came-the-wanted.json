  "lyrics": "  The sun goes down, the stars come out And all that counts, is here and now My universe will never be the same I'm glad you came You cast a spell on me, spell on me You hit me like the sky fell on me, fell on me And I decided you look well on me, well on me So let's go somewhere no-one else can see, you and me Turn the lights out now Now I'll take you by the hand Hand you another drink Drink it if you can Can you spend a little time, Time is slipping away, away from us so stay, Stay with me I can make, Make you glad you came The sun goes down, the stars come out And all that counts, is here and now My universe will never be the same I'm glad you came (The song repeats from the start of the verse with the same lyrics and same chord changes) The sun goes down, the stars come out And all that counts, is here and now My universe will never be the same I'm glad you came, Im glad you came"
