Sometimes I just hold you Too caught up in me to see, I'll try to show you each and every way I can, Now and forever, I will be your man. Now I can rest my worries and always be sure that I won't be alone anymore, if I'd only known you were there all the time all the time. Solo:      Until the day the ocean doesn't touch the sand, Now and forever, I will be your man. Now and forever, I will be your  man."
