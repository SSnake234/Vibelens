  "lyrics": "I wake up to the sounds Of the silence that allows For my mind to run around With my ear up to the ground I'm searching to behold The stories that are told When my back is to the world That was smiling when I turned Tell you you're the gr eatest But once you turn they hate us Oh the misery Ev erybody wants to be my enemy Spare the sympathy Ev erybody wants to be My enemy- y-y-y- y (Look out for yourself) My enemy (Look)-y(Look)-y(Look)-y(Look)- y(Look out for yourself) Your words up on the wall As you're praying for my fall And the laughter in the halls And the names that I've been called I stack it in my mind And I'm waiting for the time When I show you what it's like To be words spit in a mic Tell you you're the gr eatest But once you turn they hate us Oh the misery Ev erybody wants to be my enemy Spare the sympathy Ev erybody wants to be My enemy- y-y-y- y (Look out for yourself) My enemy (Look)-y(Look)-y(Look)-y(Look)- y(Look out for yourself) I'm hoping that somebody pray for me I'm praying that somebody hope for me I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be P-P-Posted Being a wreck of emotions Ready to go whenever, just let me know The enemy's on my trail, my energy unavailable I'ma tell 'em hasta luego They wanna plot on my trot to the top I've been outta shape I blasted off the planet rock To cause catastrophe And it matters more because I had it not Kinda shocking they wanted static Everybody wants to be my enemy Spare the sympathy Everybody wants to be My enem y Oh the misery Everybody wants to be my enemy Spare the sympathy Everybody wants to be My enemy ( Pray it away, I swear) (I'll never be a saint, no way) My enemy ( Pray it away, I swear) (I'll never be a saint, no way)"
