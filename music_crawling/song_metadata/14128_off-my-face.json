No words, but we speak in tongues If you let me, I might say too much Your touch blurred my vision It's your world And I'm just in it even sober I'm not thinkin' straight 'Cause I'm off my face, in love with you I'm out my head, so into you And I don't know how you do it But I'm forever ruined by you, ooh-ooh- ooh Can't sleep 'cause I'm way too buzzed Too late, now you're in my blood I don't hate the way you keep me up Your touch blurred my vision It's your world And I'm just in it even sober I'm not thinkin' straight 'Cause I'm off my face, in love with you I'm out my head, so into you And I don't know how you do it But I'm forever ruined by you, ooh-ooh- ooh Ooh, ...ooh- ooh. Ooh- ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh- ooh. Ooh-ooh-ooh- ooh Ooh, ...ooh- ooh. Ooh- ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh- ooh. Ooh-ooh-ooh- ooh 'Cause I'm off my face, in love with you I'm out my head, so into you And I don't know how you do it But I'm forever ruined by you, ooh-ooh- ooh"
