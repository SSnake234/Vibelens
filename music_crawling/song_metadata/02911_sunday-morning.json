  "lyrics": "Sunday morning rain is falling Steal some covers share some skin Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable You twist to fit the mold that I am in But things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do And I would gladly hit the road get up and go if I knew That someday it would lead me back to you That someday it would lead me back to you That may be all I need In darkness she is all I see Come and rest your bones with me Driving slow on Sunday morning And I never want to leave"
