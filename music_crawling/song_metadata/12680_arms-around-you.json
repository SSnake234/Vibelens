Yeah, she got my heart racing, racing (Yeah) Foreign cars, foreign hoes 10 bands on my Gucci coat (Ooh) Yes, I'm going to miss you though (Yuh) Put my dick straight down her throat (Damn) I know that your baby daddy broke (Broke) Take your wife backstage at a festival Penthouse, 54th floor, let's go (Let's go) And my hotel came with a stripper pole Arms around you Te amo, mami, let me hold you Got me arms right around you, girl, ooyy Good lovin' got all around you To make sure no one could harm you Dale, mami, let me have you, ooyy If you ever get to feel my touch Then you might never get enough Yes, I know you feel the ambiance (Hey) Love you like I never see you again Only real 'cause I'm not for pretend (No) Reaching out with your arms extended My love is emergency and I can sense the urgency (Ya-ah) Come, let me, woah-oh-oh Your body is just for me (For me) It was like sorcery She left me like an alcoholic Arms around you Te amo, mami, let me hold you Got me arms right around you, girl, ooyy Good lovin' got all around you To make sure no one could harm you Dale, mami, let me have you, ooyy Ey, mama (Mamá), te espera un party en mi cama (Cama) Me encanta la forma en que me hablas (Hablas) Pa' que fumemos como fumamos en La Havana Esa es la forma en que vivo, activo Que se joda el que no esté en lo mismo Yo disfruto mientras siga vivo Di que sí, que no te cuesta Si conmigo estás vestida de Chanel (Oh, yeah) Hasta los pies (Oh, yeah) Si tú te pones pa'l problema Yo me pongo como se tiene que ser De una vez, bebé, bebé (Maluma, baby) Arms around you Te amo, mami, let me hold you Got me arms right around you, girl, ooyy Good lovin' got all around you To make sure no one could harm you Dale, mami, let me have you, ooyy"
