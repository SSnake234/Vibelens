  "lyrics": " ..My love has gone away, ... quietly after a hundered days. ... This is what's she has always said she won't stay for more than what she can repay. I can still hear her say there ... that I'm not hearing tender play ... The day she let me kiss her was a display, of love to those who she betray. How can I put someone to the test, when I thought I got the best. Untill the taste of bitterness then I regret but still that I won't detest, the love I can't forget, like someone who has left. How can i leave someone for the rest when i'm alone facing the best Untill they take some try to reason i regret But still that i won't detest who i can never forget like someone i once met.."
