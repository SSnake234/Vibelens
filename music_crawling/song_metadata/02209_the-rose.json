  "lyrics": "Some say love it is a river That drowns the tender reed Some say love it is a razor That leaves your soul to bleed Some say love it is a hunger An endless aching need I say love it is a flower And you, it's only seed It's the heart afraid of breaking That never lea rns to dance It's the dream afraid of waking That never tak es a chance It's the one who won't be ta ken Who cannot seem to give And the soul afraid of dying T hat never learns to live When the night has been too lonely And the road has b een too long And you think that love is only For the lucky and the strong Just r emember in the winter Far ben eath the bitter snows Lies the s eed That with the s un's love In the spr ing Be comes the rose"
