There's a zombie on your lawn There's a zombie on your lawn There's a zombie on your lawn We don't want zombies on the lawn I know your type: tall, dark, and dead You want to bite all the petals off of my head And then eat the brains of the one who planted me here (*Homeowner*: Nooooo!) I'm just a sunflower but see me power an entire infantry You like the taste of brains, we don't like zombies *Football Zombie*: I used to play football (*Sunflower*: foot ball) *Conehead Zombie*: Road cones pro tect my head (*Sunflower*: cone on his head) *Screen Door Zombie*: I have a screen door shield (*Sunflower*:screen door shield) *All zombies*: We are the un dead! Maybe it's time to reevaluate I know you have a lot of food on your plate Brains are quite rich in cho lesterol You're dead so it doesn't matter Instead we'll use this solar power to make a lawn defense at any hour *Digger Zombie*: I like your tricycle (*Sunflower*: tricycle) *Buttered Zombie*: There's butter on my head (*Sunflower*: on his head) *Dolphin*: (*Dolphin sound*) I'm gonna eat your brains (*Sunflower*: Oh no no no) *All zombies*: We are the un dead! There's a zombie on your lawn There's a zombie on your lawn There's a zombie on your lawn We don't want zombies on the lawn Outro :  "
