  "lyrics": "  My boy's being sus he was shady enough But now he's just a shadow My boy loves his friends like I love my split ends And by that I mean he cuts em off My boy, my boy, my boy Don't love me like he promised My boy, my boy, my boy He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest My boy's being sus and he don't know how to cuss He just sounds like he's tryna be his father My boy's an ugly crier but he's such a pretty liar And by that I mean he said he'd \"change\". My boy, my boy, my boy Don't love me like he promised My boy, my boy, my boy He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest My boy , my, my boy , my friends. I love, loved, I, I love, loved my split ends My boy , my, my boy , my friends. I loved, loved, loved, loved Loved, loved, loved, loved My boy, my boy, my boy Don't love me like he promised My boy, my boy, my boy He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest You want me to be yours well then you gotta be mine. But if you want a good girl, then goodbye You want me to be yours well then you gotta be mine. And if you want a good girl, then goodbye ."
