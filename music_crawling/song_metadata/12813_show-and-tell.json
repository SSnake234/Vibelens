(Why?) If I cut myself, I would bleed (Kill me) I'm just like you, you're like me Imperfect and human, are we? Show and tell I'm on display for all you fuckers to see Show and tell Harsh words if you don't get a pic with me Buy and sell (Buy and sell me, baby) Like I'm a product to society Art don't sell Unless you fucked every authority You beg and cry for more, he had 'em on the floor There are strangers takin' pictures of me when I ask \"No more\" It's really hard for me to say just how I feel I'm scared that I'll get thrown N.C away like a banana peel Why is it so hard to see? (Why?) If I cut myself, I would bleed (Kill me) I'm just like you, you're like me Imperfect and human, are we? Show and tell I'm on display for all you fuckers to see Show and tell Harsh words if you don't get a pic with me Buy and sell (Buy and sell me, baby) Like I'm a product to society Art don't sell Unless you fucked every authority Show and tell Why can't you fucking hear me? Show and tell, um Are you listening yet? Show and tell I'm on display for all you fuckers to see Show and tell Harsh words if you don't get a pic with me Buy and sell (Buy and sell me, baby) Like I'm a product to society Art don't sell Unless you fucked every authority"
