  "lyrics": "Tone ___Born on the wrong side of the ocean ___With all the tides against you ___ ___You never thought you'd be much good for anyone ___But that's so far from the truth ___ I know there's pain in your heart And you're covered in scars ___ Wish you could see what I do 'Cause baby, every thing you are Is everything I need You're everything to me ___ Baby, every single part Is who you're meant to be 'Cause you were meant for me And you're everything I need You can say I'm wrong You can turn your back against me But I am here to stay (I am here to stay) Like the sea She keeps kissing the shoreline No matter how many times he pushes her away 'Cause baby, every thing you are Is everything I need You're everything to me ___ Baby, every single part Is who you're meant to be 'Cause you were meant for me ___ And everything hap pens for a reason It's all a bles sing in dis guise I used to ques tion who I was Well now I see The answer is in your eyes 'Cause baby, every thing you are Is everything I need You're everything to me ___ Baby, every single part Is who you're meant to be 'Cause you were meant for me And you're everything I need"
