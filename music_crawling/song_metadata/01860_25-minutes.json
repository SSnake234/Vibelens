  "lyrics": "After some time, I've finally made up my mind she is the girl and I really want to make her mine I´m searching everywhere to find her again to tell her I love her and I'm sorry ´bout the things I´ve done I find her standing in front of the church the only place in town where I didn´t search She looks so happy in her wedding dress but she´s crying while she´s saying this Boy I´ve missed your kisses all the time but this is twenty five minutes too late Though you travelled so far boy I´m sorry your are twenty five minutes too late Against the wind I´m going home again wishing me back to the time when we were more than friends But still I see her in front of the church the only place in town where I didn´t search She looked so happy in her weddingdress but she cryed while she was saying this Boy I´ve missed your kisses all the time but this is twenty five minutes too late Though you travelled so far boy I´m sorry your are twenty five minutes too late Out in the streets places where hungry hearts have nothing to eat inside my head still I can hear the words she said (hear the words she said) Boy I´ve missed your kisses all the time but this is twenty five minutes too late Though you travelled so far boy I´m sorry your are twenty five minutes too late Boy I´ve missed your kisses all the time but this is twenty five minutes too late Though you travelled so far boy I´m sorry your are twenty five minutes too late I can still hear her say"
