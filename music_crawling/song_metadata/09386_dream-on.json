  "lyrics": "Intro:    Every time that I look in the mirror All these lines on my face gettin' clearer  The past is gone It went by like dusk to dawn Isn't that the way Everybody's got their dues in life to pay?  I know nobody knows where it comes and where it goes I know it's everybody's sin You got to lose to know how to win    Half my life's in books' written pages Lived and learned from fools and from sages  You know it's true all those things come back to you Sing with me, sing for the years Sing for the laughter 'n' sing for the tears Sing with me if it's just for today Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away  (X8) Sing with me, sing for the years Sing for the laughter 'n' sing for the tears Sing with me if it's just for today Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away Dream on, dream on, dream on Dream yourself a dream come true Dream on, dream on, dream on Dream until your dream come true Dream on, Dream on, Dream on, Dream on Dream on, Dream on, Dream on  Ah------ (X8) Sing with me, sing for the years Sing for the laughter 'n' sing for the tears Sing with me if it's just for today Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away Sing with me, sing for the years Sing for the laughter 'n' sing for the tears Sing with me if it's just for today Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away  - fade out"
