  "lyrics": "  A heart that's full up like a land fill Bruises that won't heal You look so tired, unhappy Bring down the government They don't, they don't speak for us I'll take a quiet life A handshake of carbon monoxide With no alarms and no surprises No alarms and no surprises No alarms and no surprises Silent , silent This is my final fit My final belly ache With no alarms and no surprises No alarms and no surprises No alarms and no surprises, please   Such a pretty house And such a pretty garden no alarms and no surprises no alarms and no surprises No alarms and no surprises, please    "
