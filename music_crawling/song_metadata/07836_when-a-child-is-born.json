  "lyrics": "A ray of hope flitters in the sky A shiny star lights up way up high All a cross the land dawns a brand new morn This comes to pass when a child is born A silent wish sails the seven seas The winds have changed whisperin the trees And the walls of doubt crumble tossed and torn This comes to pass when a child is born A rosy fume settles all a round You've got the feel you're on solid ground For a spell or two no-one seems forlorn This comes to pass when a child is born It's all a dream and illusion now It must come true, sometimes soon some how All a cross the land dawns a brand new morn This comes to pass when a child is born"
