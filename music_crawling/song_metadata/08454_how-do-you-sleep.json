Tone     I'm done hating myself for feeling I'm done crying myself awake I've gotta leave and start the healing But when you move like that, I just want to stay But what have I become? I'm Looking through your phone now, oh now Love to you is just a game Look what I have done, I'm Dialing up the numbers on you I don't want my heart to break Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me? All that shame and all that danger I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me? All that fear and all that pressure I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight Tell me how do you   Love will keep you up tonight Tell me how do you Oh no, how did I manage to lose me? I am not this desperate, not this crazy There's no way I'm stickin' 'round to find out I won't lose like that, I won't lose myself Look what I have done, I'm Dialing up the numbers on you I don't want my heart to break Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me? All that shame and all that danger I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me? All that fear and all that pressure I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight Tell me how do you   Love will keep you up tonight Tell me how do you   Love will keep you up tonight Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me? All that shame and all that danger I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me? All that fear and all that pressure I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight (Tell me how do you)"
