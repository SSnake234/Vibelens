  "lyrics": "I asked her to stay, but she wouldn't listen She left before I had the chance to say, oh the words that were meant, the things that were broken But now it's far too late she's gone away. Every night you cry yourself to sleep Thinking why does this hap pen to me Why does every moment have to be so hard? It's not over tonight Just give me one more chance to make it right I may not make it through the night I won't go home without you The taste of her breath, I'll never get over And the noises that she made keep me awake, oh the weight of things, re main unspoken built up so much it crushed us everyday Every night you cry yourself to sleep Thinking why does this hap pen to me Why does every moment have to be so hard? It's not over tonight Just give me one more chance to make it right I may not make it through the night I won't go home without you It's not over tonight Just give me one more chance to make it right I may not make it through the night I won't go home without you Of all the things I felt I've never really showed Perhaps the worst is that I ever let you go, It's not over tonight Just give me one more chance to make it right I may not make it through the night I won't go home without you It's not over tonight Just give me one more chance to make it right I may not make it through the night I won't go home without you I won’t go home without you I won’t go home without you"
