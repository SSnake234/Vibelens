  "lyrics": "1.How are you? It has been a long time I hope that you are doing fine It’s you that I miss all this while Feels like a never ending trial I was wrong, thought that I gave my all We could have been something more And now, starting to rea lise You've kept your heart but I’ve lost mine I wish that I could hold you close, with my tears, through the night No one else but you are mine, I am yours, by your side Where are you now? I wanna know Some things were meant to stay in my soul I just wanna be by your side, talk to you, say goodnight Sometimes there’s no second chance in this life can’t rewind The love we knew when you once loved me too I can't undo the things I’ve done How are you now? 2.Heaven knows, I’m slowly breaking down All alone without a sound Your lips, all that I need right now For you I’ll walk a million miles I wish that I could hold you close, with my tears, through the night No one else but you are mine, I am yours, by your side Where are you now? I wanna know Some things were meant to stay in my soul I just wanna be by your side, talk to you, say goodnight Sometimes there’s no second chance in this life can’t rewind The love we knew when you once loved me too I can't undo the things I’ve done How are you now?"
