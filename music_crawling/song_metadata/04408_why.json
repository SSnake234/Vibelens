Tell me You think we can last forever? Tell me... Hey listen to what we're not saying So go and think - about whatever you need to think about Go on and dream about what - ever you need to dream about And come back to  me when - you notice how you feel, you feel I can feel, I - can feel you near me Even though you're far away I can feel, I - can feel you baby why It's not supposed - to feel this way I need you I need you more and more each day It's not supposed - to hurt this way I need you I need you I need you tell me It's not supposed - to feel this way I need you I need you more and more each day It's not supposed - to hurt this way I need you I need you I need you tell me Are you and me still together? Tell me You think we can last forever? Tell me... --- --- ----- Why?"
