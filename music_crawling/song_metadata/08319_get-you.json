Don't you love when I come around Bill you up then I take you down Don't you love when I come around (...feel something that's right somebody just tell somebody) Build you up then I take... Oooooooh, who would've thought I'd get you Oh yeah, oh yeah baby Oooooooh, who would've thought I'd get you This feels like summer Boy you make me feel so alive Just be my lover Boy you'll lead me to paradise"
