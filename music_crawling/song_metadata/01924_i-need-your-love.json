I walk in circles but I'll never figure out What I mean to you, do I belong I try to fight this but I know I'm not that strong And I feel so helplessly Watch my eyes are filled with fear Tell me do you feel the same Hold me in your arms again I need your love I need your time When everything's wrong You make it right I feel so high I come alive I need to be free with you tonight I need your love All the years And now my eyes are perfect And all the tears And now my eyes are open I need your love I need your time When everything's wrong You make it right I feel so high I come alive I need to be free with you tonight I need your love  "
