  "lyrics": "   Do you remember when I said I'd always be there. Ever since we were ten, baby. When we were out on the playground playing pretend. I didn't know it back then. Now I realize you were the only one It's never too late to show it. Grow old together, Have feelings we had before Back when we were so innocent I pray for all your love Girl our love is so unreal I just wanna reach and touch you, squeeze you, somebody pinch me This is something like a movie And I don't know how it ends girl but I fell in love with my Best Friend Through all the dudes that came by And all the nights that you'd cry. Girl I was there right by your side. How could I tell you I loved you When you were so happy With some other guy? Now I realize you were the only one It's never too late to show it. Grow old together, Have feelings we had before Back when we were so innocent I pray for all your love Girl our love is so unreal I just wanna reach and touch you, squeeze you, somebody pinch me This is something like a movie And I don't know how it ends girl but I fell in love with my Best Friend I know it sounds crazy That you'd be my baby. Girl you mean that much to me. And nothing compares when We're lighter than air and We don't wanna come back down. But I don't wanna ruin what we have Love is so unpredictable. But it's the risk that I'm taking, Hoping, praying You'd fall in love with your best friend   I pray for all your love Girl our love is so unreal I just wanna reach and touch you, squeeze you, somebody pinch me This is something like a movie And I don't know how it ends girl but I fell in love with my Best Friend   I remember when I said I'd always be there Ever since we were ten."
