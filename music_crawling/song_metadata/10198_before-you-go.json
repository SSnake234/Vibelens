  "lyrics": "I fell by the wayside, like everyone else I hate you, I hate you, I Our every moment, I start to replace ‘cause now that they’re gone I hear When you hurt under the surface Like troubled water running co ld Well time can heal but this wont So Before you go Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better? If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather So Before you go Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting? It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless So Before you go Was never the right time, whenever you called Went little by little by little, until there was nothing at all Our every moment, I start to replay When all I can think about is seeing that look on your face When you hurt under the surface Like troubled water running cold Well time can heal but this wont So Before you go Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better? If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather So Before you go Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting? It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless So Before you go Would we be better off by now? If I'd l et my walls come down? Maybe I guess we’ll never know You know, you know, you know Before you go Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better? If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather So Before you go Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting? It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless So Before you go"
