In the rain Every thing is ok, you will be ok Hold me sway! Hold me sway! Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday Ta di da da da! Singing la la la Let the rain wash a way Ta di da da da! Singing la la la Let the rain wash a way Everything will be o k (Everything will be ok) Everything will be o k (Everything will be ok) But now whenever I cry in the rain someone helps me hide it He’s always my best friend, when I fall down he never laughs In the rain! In the rain Every thing is ok, you will be ok Hold me sway! Hold me sway! Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday Ta di da da da! Singing la la la Let the rain wash a way Ta di da da da! Singing la la la Let the rain wash a way ... ...Take me a Hway, take me a way to the new highway ... ...Take me a way, take me a way in another day ! In the rain! In the rain Every thing is ok, you will be ok Hold me sway! Hold me sway! Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday Ta di da da da! Singing la la la Let the rain wash a way Ta di da da da! Singing la la la Let the rain wash a way"
