Lay back It's all been done before And if you could only let it be I like you the way you are When we're drivin in your car And you're talkin to me one-on-one Somebody else Round everyone else Watchin your back Like you can't relax You tryin to be cool You look like a fool to me , Tell me Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated ? I see the way you're actin like you're somebody else Gets me frusterated Life's like this you You fall and you crawl and you break and you take what you get And you turn into Honestly, you promised me I'm never gonna find you fake it No no no"
