  "lyrics": "Hợp âm chia ở Tone - Tone gốc E: Capo 4 I can't believe I'm standing here. Been waiting for so many years and, Today I found the queen to reign my heart. You changed my life so patiently, And turned it into something good and real. I feel just like I felt in all my dreams … There are questions hard to answer, can't you see... Baby, tell me how can I tell you, That I love you more than life? Show me how can I show you, That I'm blinded by your light. When you touch me, I can touch you, To find out the dream is true. I love to be loved by you. You're looking kinda scared right now, You're waiting for the wedding vows. But I don't know if my tongue's able to talk. Your beauty is just blinding me, Like sunbeams on a summer stream and I, Gotta close my eyes to protect me. Can you take my hand and lead me from here please? Baby, tell me how can I tell you, That I love you more than life? Show me how can I show you, That I'm blinded by your light. When you touch me, I can touch you, To find out the dream is true. I love to be loved … I need to be loved … I love to be loved by you. I know they're gonna say, Our love's not strong enough to last forever. And I know they're gonna say that we'll give up Because of heavy weather. But how can they understand That our love is just heaven-sent, We keep on going on and on, Cause this is where we both belong. Baby, tell me how can I tell you That I love you more than life? Show me how can I show you That I'm blinded by your light. When you touch me I can touch you, To find out the dream is true. I love to be loved … I need, yes I need to be loved … I love to be loved by you. Yes, I love to be loved by you."
