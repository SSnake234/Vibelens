  "lyrics": "Boys seem to like the girls Who laugh at anything The ones who get undressed Before the second date Girls seem to like the boys Who don't appreciate All the money and the time that it takes To be fly as a mother Got my both eyes out for Mr. Right Guessing I just don't know where to find 'em But I hope they all come out tonight Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away? I'm a good, good girl who needs a little company Looking high and low, someone let me know Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away? Boys seem to like the girls Who like to kiss and tell Talking them up about the things they do so well But I'd rather find a boy Who is down for the case Putting in the time that it takes To be fly as a mother To supply all of my heart's demands Suit and tie cause under cover He's gonna save my life like superman Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away? I'm a good, good girl who needs a little company Looking high and low, someone let me know Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away? Tell me where the good boys go Tell me where the good boys go Tell me where the good boys go Won't somebody tell me, tell me Tell me where the good boys go Tell me where the good boys go Tell me where the good boys go Tell me where the good boys go Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away? I'm a good, good girl who needs a little company Looking high and low, someone let me know Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away? Hide away, hide away Hide away, hide away Looking high and low, someone let me know Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?"
