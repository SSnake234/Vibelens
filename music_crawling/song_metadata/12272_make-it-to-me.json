And make it to me... So sick of this lonely air It seems such a waste of breath So much that I need to say So much to get off my chest I'm waiting patiently though time is moving slow I have one vacancy and I wanted you to know that You're the one designed for me A distant stranger that I will complete I know you're out there we're meant to be So keep your head up...and make it to me Beat ........ ....... ......... And make it to meeeeEEEEEeeeeeeeEeEeEeeee... Beat ........ ........ ........ And make it to meEeEEEEEEEeeeeee... Beat ....... ....... .......... And make it to meeeeeeeeeEee..."
