  "lyrics": "So keep in me up at night It unfamiliar round Feels it's like where for? It's like breaking down We going through the rush I'm scare you're gonna leave When I even talking But right now I'm gonna speak No more hiding, break the silents now Do we quit or try to work things out Where do we go? Where do we go from here Are we ready to just give it up Should we turn our back on love Or should we stand withing I don't wanna let it go but i can just speak and fight for it Let's see good chance for love i can't go on like this Where do we go? Where do we Where do we go? Where do we Where do we go? tell me Where do we go from here. If we begin on where we are Try to mend the problems now We've been looking forward instead of looking back I don't wanna play it safe 'cos i wanna cross the line Feel just like we're standing, we're running out of time"
