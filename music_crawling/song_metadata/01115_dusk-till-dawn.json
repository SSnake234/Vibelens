Can you feel it through All of the windows Inside this room 'Cause I wanna touch you baby I wanna feel you too I wanna see the sunrise in your Sins just me and you Light it up, on the run Let's make love, tonight Make it up, fall in love, try ( Baby, I'm right here) But you'll never be alone I'll be with you from dusk till dawn I'll be with you from dusk till dawn I'll hold you when things go wrong I'll be with you from dusk till dawn I'll be with you from dusk till dawn Baby, I'm right here I'll be with you from dusk till dawn We were shut like a jacket So do your zip We would roll down the rapids To find a wave that fits Can you feel where the wind is? Can you feel it through All of the windows Inside this room 'Cause I wanna touch you baby I wanna feel you too I wanna see the sunrise in your Sins just me and you Light it up, on the run Let's make love, tonight Make it up, fall in love, try ( Baby, I'm right here) But you'll never be alone I'll be with you from dusk till dawn I'll be with you from dusk till dawn I'll hold you when things go wrong I'll be with you from dusk till dawn I'll be with you from dusk till dawn Baby, I'm right here Could give love to your body? So, only you that can stop it Go, give love to your body So, only you that can stop it Go, give love to your body So, only you that can stop it Go, give love to your body But you'll never be alone I'll be with you from dusk till dawn I'll be with you from dusk till dawn I'll hold you when things go wrong I'll be with you from dusk till dawn I'll be with you from dusk till dawn Baby, I'm right here I'll be with you from dusk till dawn Baby, I'm right here"
