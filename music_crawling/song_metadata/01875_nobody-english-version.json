Why you tryin' to, to make me leave you I know what you're thinking baby why aren't you listening How can I just, just love someone else And forget you completel, when I know you still love me Telling me you're not good enough My life with you is just too tough You know it's not right so just stop and come back boy How can this be when we were meant to be. Chorus: I want nobody nobody but you I want nobody nobody but you How can I be with another I don't want any other I want nobody nobody nobody nobody. (X 2) 2. Why can't we just, just be like this ‘cause It's you that I need and nothing else until the end Who else can ever make me feel the way I I feel when I'm with you no one will ever do. Telling me you're not good enough My life with you is just too tough You know me enough so you know what I need boy Right next to you is where I need to be Chorus: I want nobody nobody but you I want nobody nobody but you How can I be with another I don't want any other I want nobody nobody nobody nobody. (X 2) Bridge: I don't want no- body~body I don't want no- body~body Honey you know, it's you that I want It's you that I need why can't you see. Chorus: I want nobody nobody but you I want nobody nobody but you How can I be with another I don't want any other I want nobody nobody nobody nobody. (X 2)"
