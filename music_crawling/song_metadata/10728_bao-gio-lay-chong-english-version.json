My smile has suddenly disappeared I don’t wanna get married I want to stay with mom and dad At New Year’s I come home and I make... Sweets for my grandparents. New Year’s Eve with my fami ly Don’t you ask ‘bout my mar riage Don’t you ask ‘bout my mar riage This spring I won’t get mar ried I don’t wan na get mar ried New Year’s I’m visiting my grandparents My relatives ask me: Spinster, are you? Where’s your boyfriend, why don’t you take him home? My God, why does everyone ask me this? Got married yet? Got married yet? Got married yet? Got married yet? My smile has suddenly disappeared I don’t wanna get married I want to stay with mom and dad At New Year’s I come home and I make... Sweets for my grandparents. New Year’s Eve with my fami ly Don’t you ask ‘bout my mar riage Don’t you ask ‘bout my mar riage This spring I won’t get mar ried I don’t wan na get mar ried"
