No more cham- pagne and the fireworks are through Here we are, me and you, feeling lost and feeling blue It's the end of the party and the morning seems so grey So un- like yester- day, now's the time for us to say Chorus: Happy new year, happy new year May we all have a vision now and then Of a world where every neighbour is a friend Happy new year, happy new year May we all have our hopes, our will to try If we don't we might as well lay down and die You and I ( You and I) 2. Sometimes I see, how the brave new world ar- rives And I see how it thrives, in the ashes of our lives Oh yes, man is a fool and he thinks he'll be okay Dragging on, feet of clay, never knowing he's a tray Keeps on going any way 3. Seems to me now, that the dreams we had be- fore Are all dead, nothing more, than con- fetti on the floor It's the end of a decade, in another ten years time Who can say what we'll find, what lies waiting down the line In the end of eighty- nine "
