Some legends are told Some turn to dust or to gold but you will remember me remember me for centuries if just one mistake is all it will take we’ll go down in history remember me for centuries  heh eh remember me for centuries mummified my teenage dreams no it's nothing wrong with me the kids are all wrong, the story's all off heavy metal broke my (heart) come on come on and let me in bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints this is supposed to match, the darkness that you felt I never meant for you to fix yourself I can't stop until the whole world knows my name 'cause I was only born inside my dreams until you die for me, as long as theres a light  my shadows over you 'cause I-I- am the opposite of amnesia and you're a cherry blossom, you're about to bloom you look so pretty but you're gone so soon we've been here forever  and here's the frozen proof I could scream forever  we are the poisoned you Da Da Da... x2"
