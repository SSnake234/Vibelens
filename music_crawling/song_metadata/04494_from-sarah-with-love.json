  "lyrics": "And yes I always knew what we could do Felt the night you said That love had come to you I thought that I could never feel for you And so you left For someone new And now that you're far and away I'm sending a letter today From Sarah with love She'd got the lover she is dreaming of She never found the words to say but I know that today She's gonna send her letter to you From Sarah with love She took your picture to the stars above And they told her it is true She could dare to fall in love with you So don't make her blue when she writes to you From Sarah with love So maybe the chance for romance Is like a train to catch before it's gone You're strong enough to understand As long as you're so far away I'm sending a letter each day From Sarah with love She'd got the lover she is dreaming of She never found the words to say but I know that today She's gonna send her letter to you From Sarah with love She took your picture to the stars above And they told her it is true She could dare to fall in love with you So don't make her blue when she writes to you From Sarah with love From Sarah with  love She'd got the lover she is dreaming of She never found the words to say but I know that today She's gonna send her letter to you From Sarah with love She's gotta know what you are thinking of 'Cause every little now and then and again and again I know her heart cries out for you From Sarah with love She'd got the lover she is dreaming of She took your picture to the stars above And they told her it is true She could dare to fall in love with you So don't make her blue when she writes to you From Sarah with love So don't make me blue when I write to you From Sarah with love"
