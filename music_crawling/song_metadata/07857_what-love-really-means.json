He prays every night, \"Dear God won't you please, could you send somone here who will love me?\" Who will love me for me? Not for what I have done or what I will become. Who will love me for me? 'Cause nobody has shown me what love, what love really means. Her office is shrinking a little each day, she's the woman whose husband has run away. She'll go to the gym after working today, Maybe if she was thinner then he would've stayed. Who will love me for me? Not for what I have done or what I will become. Who will love me for me? 'Cause nobody has shown me what love, what love really means. He's waiting to die as he sits all alone, he's a man in a cell who regrets what he's done. He utters a cry fron the depths of his soul, \"Oh Lord, forgive me, I want to go home.\" The he heard a voice, somewhere deep inside and it said, \" I know you've murdered and I know you've lied I have watched you suffer all of your life and now that you'll listen, I'll tell you that I. . . I will love you for you . Not for what you have done or what you will become I will love you for you I will give you the love, the love that you never knew"
