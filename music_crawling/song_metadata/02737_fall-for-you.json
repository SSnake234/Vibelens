  "lyrics": "The | best thing about tonight’s that we’re not | | fighting. It couldn’t | | be that we have been this way be-| fore_ I | know you don’t think that I am | trying_ I | know you’re wearing thin down to the | | Core. But | hold your breath_ Because to-| night will be the night_ That I will | fall for you_ Over a-| gain. Don’t make me change my | mind_ I won’t | live to see another day_ I | swear its true_ Because a | girl like you is impossible to | | Find. You’re impossible to | Find | __ | __ | __ | | _ This is not what I in-| tended_ I always | swore to you that_ I would never fall a-| part | | You always thought that I was | stronger_ I may have | failed_ But I have loved you from the | start_ Oh, But | hold your breath_ Because to-| night will be the night_ That I will | fall for you_ Over a-| gain. Don’t make me change my | mind_ I won’t | live to see another day_ I | swear its true_ Because a | girl like you is impossible to | | Find. You’re impossible_ So | breathe | in so | deep | | Breathe me | in_ I’m | yours to | keep_ And |hold onto your | words_ ‘Cause | talk is | cheap_ And | remember me to-| night_ When you’re as-| leep_ Because to-| night will be the night That I will | fall for you_ Over a-| gain. Don’t make me change my | mind_ I won’t | live to see another day_ I | swear its true_ Because a | girl like you is impossible to | find_ To-| night will be the night_ That I will | fall for you_ Over a-| gain. Don’t make me change my | mind_ I won’t | live to see another day_ I | swear it’s true_ Because a | girl like you is impossible to | | find. You’re impossible to | find ||"
