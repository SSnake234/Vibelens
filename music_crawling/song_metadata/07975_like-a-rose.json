  "lyrics": "And as I look into your eyes I see an angel in disguise Sent from God above To hold and idolise And as I hold your body near I'll see this month through to a year And then forever on I'll keep your loving near And now I've finally found my way To lead me down this lonely road All have to do To lighten off my load You treat me like a rose You give me room to grow You shone the light of love on me And gave me air so I can breathe You open doors that close In a world where anything goes You give me strength so I stand tall Within this bed of earth Just like a rose And when I feel like hope is gone You give me strength to carry on Each time I look at you To keep our loving strong I hear you whisper in my ear All of the words I long to hear Of how you'll always be To wipe away my tears And now I've finally found my way To lead me down this lonely road All have to do To lighten off my load You treat me like a rose You give me room to grow You shone the light of love on me And gave me air so I can breathe You open doors that close In a world where anything goes You give me strength so I stand tall Within this bed of earth And though the seasons change Our love remains the same Just like a rose You face the thunder When the sunshine turns to rain Just like a rose You treat me like a rose You give me room to grow You shone the light of love on me And gave me air so I can breathe You open doors that close In a world where anything goes You give me strength so I stand tall Within this bed of earth Just like a rose"
