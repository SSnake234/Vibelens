  "lyrics": "  (x2) My lungs are black, my heart is pure My hands are scarred from nights before And my hair is thinnin', falling out of all the wrong places I am a little insecure My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue I bite my nails and tell the truth I go from thin to overweight, day to day it fluctuates My skin is inked, but faded, too But she loves me, she loves me Why the hell would she love me When she could have anyone else? Oh, you love me, you love me Why the hell would you love me 'Cause I don't even love myself  Baby, the best part of me is you And lately, everything's making sense, too Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you   (x2) I overthink and still forgive I lose my phone and place my bits And I never catch the train on time, always 30 minutes behind Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet But you love me, you love me Why the hell you love me so When you could have anyone else? Yeah, he loves me, he loves me And I bet he never lets me go And shows me how to love myself 'Cause, baby, the best part of me is you, woah And lately, everything's making sense, too Baby, I'm so in love with you     Baby, the best part of me is you, woah And lately, everything's making sense, too Baby, I'm so in love with you (Oh) Baby, I'm so in love with you (Yeah, yeah) Baby, I'm so in love with you"
