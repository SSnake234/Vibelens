  "lyrics": "Intro:  x2 I'm tired of being what you want me to be Feeling so faithless lost under the surface Don't know what you're expecting of me Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes Every step I take is another mistake to you I've become so numb I can't feel you there I've become so tired so much more aware I've becoming this all I want to do Is be more like me and be less like you Can't you see that you're smothering me Holdin g too tightly afraid to lose control Cause everything that you thought I would be Has fallen apart right in front of you Every step that I take is another mistake to you And every second I waste is more than I can take I've become so numb I can't feel you there I've become so tired so much more aware I've becoming this all I want to do Is be more like me and be less like you And I know I may end up fai ling too But I know You were just like me with someone disappointed in you I've become so numb I can't feel you there I've become so tired so much more aware I've becoming this all I want to do Is be more like me and be less like you Become so numb ( I'm Tired of being what you want me to be) I've become so numb ( I'm Tired of being what you want me to be)"
