  "lyrics": "Tonight , It's just the two of us So forget the world for a while Open your heart and open your eyes I'm right here in front of you. And you look so pretty in your dress Though I knows I look like a mess, I'll do my best to win your heart So can I walk you home tonight? Please tell me how you feel Cause deep inside I know it's real I promise, I will forever be yours Darling open up to me, Let me walk you home Before its morning, before the sunrise Before I go back to reality And you go back to your life Tell me that you feel the same way too Please tell me how you feel Cause deep inside I know it's real I promise, I will forever be yours Darling open up to me, Let me walk you home Even if you'll never be mine I'm in love with you, tonight"
