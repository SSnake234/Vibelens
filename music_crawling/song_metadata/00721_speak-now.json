  "lyrics": " I am not the kind of girl Who should be rudely barging in On a white veil occasion But you are not the kind of boy Who should be marrying the wrong girl I sneak in and see your friends And her snotty little family All dressed in pastel And she is yelling at a bridesmaid Somewhere back inside a room Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry Thi--is i---is surely not What you thought it would be I---I lose myself in a daydream Don't say \"Yes\" run away now I'll meet you when you're out Of the church at the back door Don't wait or say a single vow You need to hear me out And they said \"Speak Now\"  Fond gestures are exchanged And the organ starts to play a song That sounds like a death march And I am hiding in the curtains It seems that I was uninvited By your lovely bride-to-be She---e floats down the aisle Like a pageant queen But I--I kno--ow You wish it was me You wish it was me- Don't you? Don't say \"Yes\" run away now I'll meet you when you're out Of the church at the back door Don't wait or say a single vow You need to hear me out And they said \"Speak Now\" Don't say \"Yes\" run away now I'll meet you when you're out Of the church at the back door Don't wait or say a single vow Your time is running out And they said \"Speak Now\" Ohooho laaaah hoh Oooh(Say you see me now)ooohooh I hear the preacher say speak now Or forever hold your pe--- ace There's a silence, there's my last chance I stand up with shaky hands All eyes on me Horrified looks from everyone in the room But I'm only lookin' at you I am not the kind of girl Who should be rudely barging in On a white veil occasion But you are not the kind of boy Who should be marrying the wrong girl Oops! Don't say \"Yes\" run away now I'll meet you when you're out Of the church at the back door Don't wait or say a single vow You need to hear me out They said \"Speak Now\" And you say \"Lets run away now\" I'll meet you when I'm out Of my tux at the back door Baby I didn't say my vows So glad you were around When they said \"Speak no--ow\""
