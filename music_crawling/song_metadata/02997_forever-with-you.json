  "lyrics": "   Like shooting stars how brief we are And I wish this moment could last forever Here with You I am made new I want to live like every breath matters You are not so far away, just hear me when I say I want to love what You love, I want to see what You see I want a hope that burns like a fire in me I want Your light in my life, I want my heart renewed Here I am forever with You    The falling rain can bring a change I never knew how farther I could fall I can hardly wait till I see You face to face I can't believe Your love remains the same You are not so far away, just hear me when I say I want to love what You love, I want to see what You see I want a hope that burns like a fire in me I want Your light in my life, I want my heart renewed Here I am forever with You Now I live with You after all that I've been through I just can't live without the grace You gave to me Now I see what You see Your beautiful life forever in me [A m] I w ant to [F]love what You love, [C]I want to [G]see what You see I want a hope that burns like a fire in me I want Your light in my life, I want my heart renewed Here I am Here I am Here I am forever with You  "
