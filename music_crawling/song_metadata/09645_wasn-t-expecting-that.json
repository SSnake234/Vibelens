  "lyrics": "It was only a smile but my heart it went wild and I wasn't expecting that just a delicate kiss, anyone could've missed I wasn't expecting that Did I misread the sign? Your hand slipped into mine I wasn't expecting that You spent the night in my bed , you woke up and you said \"Well, I wasn't expecting that\" I thought love wasn't meant to last, I thought you were just passing through If I ever get the nerve to ask What did I get right to deserve somebody like you? I wasn't expecting that It was only a word , it was almost mis-heard 'Cause I wasn't expecting that But it came without fear , a month turned into a year And I wasn't expecting that I thought love wasn't meant to last, I thought you were just passing through If I ever get the nerve to ask What did I get right to deserve somebody like you? I wasn't expecting that         Isn't it strange how a life can be changed in the flicker of the sweetest smile We were married in spring You know I wouldn't change a thing Without an innocent kiss, what a life I'd have missed, If you'd not took a chance on a little romance When I wasn't expecting that Time doesn't take long , three kids up and gone And  I wasn't expecting that And when the nurses they came, said its come back again I wasn't expecting that Then you closed your eyes , took my heart by surprise And   I wasn't expecting that"
