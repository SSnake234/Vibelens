  "lyrics": "Right outside my window all the snow is coming down The Brooklyn Bridge is blanketed It’s quiet all around The city lights are blinking bright just like a Christmas tree That I remember from old Decembers I’ve got my favorite jacket on there’s snowflakes in the air We made a reservation but we’ll never make it there The fire’s too inviting there’s nowhere I’d rather be There’s something about you that I’m getting used to Baby just be mine a kinda sorta Christmas Valen tine You’re making every day with you and I Feel like a very merry February Baby just be mine just say you’ll be my Christmas Valen tine I wanna make every day a holiday with you It doesn’t matter rain or shine in summer or in fall If all the roses are in bloom or nothing is at all ‘Cause love it has no calendar it’s always evergreen Let’s make another reason to love the season Baby just be mine a kinda sorta Christmas Valen tine You’re making every day with you and I Feel like a very merry February Baby just be mine just say you’ll be my Christmas Valen tine I wanna make every day a holiday with you Every day, every day, every day  Baby just be mine a kinda sorta Christmas Valen tine You’re making every day with you and I Feel like a very merry February Baby just be mine just say you’ll be my Christmas Valen tine I wanna make every day a holiday Every day a holiday Every day a holiday with you"
