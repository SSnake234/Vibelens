  "lyrics": "I've been trying to reach you Cause I got something to say But you're talking about just nothing at all And you're slipping away We were crying together It was a long time ago Before you walk out the door And leave me this way Just hear what I say You make me feel, you make me real For the rest of my days in so many ways You make me feel  I've been trying to leave you Why should we go on like this? But my heart can't breathe When I hear you say It's better this way You make me feel, you make me real For the rest of my days in so many ways You make me feel Ten thousand light years away from you Keep thinking maybe it's time to let go But by the end of the day I still want to say do you    (You make me feel) You make me feel(oh oh) You make me real(so real) For the rest of my days in so many ways You make me feel I've been trying to reach you(you make me feel) Cause I got something to say(You make me real) For the rest of my days, in so many ways You make me feel"
