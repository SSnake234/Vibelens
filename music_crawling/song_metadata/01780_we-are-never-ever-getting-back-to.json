  "lyrics": "I remember when we broke up the first time Saying, \"This is it, I've had enough,\" 'cause like We hadn't seen each other in a month When you said you needed space. What? Then you come around again and say \"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change Trust me, remember how that lasted for a day\" I say, \"I hate you, we break up,\" you call me, \"I love you\". Oooh oh …we called it off again last night But oooh oh …, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you. Chorus: We are never ever ever getting back to- gether We are never ever ever getting back to- gether You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me But we are never ever ever ever getting back to- gether, like ever... I'm really gonna miss you picking fights And me, falling for it screaming that I'm right And you, would hide away and find your piece of mind With some indie record that's much cooler than mine. Oooh oh …we called it off again last night But oooh oh …, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you. Chorus: We are never ever ever getting back to- gether We are never ever ever getting back to- gether You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me But we are never ever ever ever getting back to- gether, like ever... Bridge: I used to think that we were for- ever ever ever And I used to say never say never Huh, so he calls me up and he's like, \"I still love you\" And I'm like, \"I just, I mean this is exhausting, you know We are never getting back together, like ever\". Chorus: We are never ever ever getting back to- gether We are never ever ever getting back to- gether You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me But we are never ever ever ever getting back to- gether We (Ooh -ooh-ooh -ooh), getting back together We (Ooh -ooh-ooh -ooh), getting back together You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me But we are never ever ever ever getting back to- gether"
