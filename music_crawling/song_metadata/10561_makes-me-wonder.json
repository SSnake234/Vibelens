  "lyrics": "I wake up with blood-shot eyes Struggled to memorize The way it felt between your thighs Pleasure that made you cry Feels so good to be bad Not worth the aftermath, after that After that Try to get you back I still don't have the reason And you don' t have the time And it really makes me wonder If I ever gave a fuck about you Give me something to believe in Cause I don't believe in you anymore Anymore I wonder if it even makes a difference to try So this is goodbye"
