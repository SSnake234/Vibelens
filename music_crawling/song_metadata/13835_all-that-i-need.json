To let go of love And break all the ru les G irl, when you walked out that door Left a hole in my heart And now I know for sure Y ou're the air that I breathe Girl, you're all that I need And I wanna thank you la dy Y ou're the words that I read You're the light that I see And your love is all that I need Girl, I almost let love slip right out of my hands"
