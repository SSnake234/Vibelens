  "lyrics": "You should know that a man with the power of nature Can bring you to the end of your luck And you should know by my stride and the look in my eyes That you're about to be massively force to give up. Chicken attack , chicken attack Watch your back before it fades to black They might look harmless but they'll kick your non- chicken ass Go chicken go , go chicken go Now go, now fly . You own the sky With the power of nature, you'll never alone And you can't let evil run amok Every beast, every tree, follow me to the end And you're about to be massively fucked You're young and you're hungry, perhaps short on money I'll give you this chicken today Its eggs for the dinner, its legs for the winter You won't have to steal again"
