I'm way too young to be this hurt I feel doomed in hotel rooms, Staring straight up at the wall Counting wounds and I am trying to numb them all, do you care, do you care? Why don't you care? I gave you all of me My blood, my sweat, my heart, and my tears, Why don't you care, why don't you care? I was there, I was there , when no one was. Now you're gone and I'm here Number one, tell me who you think you are, You got some nerve trying to tear my faith apart (I have questions) Number two, why would you try to play me for a fool? I should have never ever ever trusted you (I have questions) Number three, why weren't you, who you swore that you would be I have questions, I got questions haunting me I have questions for you, I have questions for you I have questions for you My, my name was safest in your mouth And why'd you have to go, and spit it out? Oh, your voice was the most familiar sound But it sounds so dangerous to me now Number one, tell me who you think you are, You got some nerve trying to tear my faith apart (I have questions) Number two, why would you try to play me for a fool? I should have never ever ever trusted you (I have questions) I have questions for you I have questions for you (I have questions) I have questions for you Do you care, do you care? Why don't you care? I gave you all of me My blood, my sweat, my heart, and my tears, why don't you care, why don't you care? I was there, I was there , when no one was Now you're gone and I'm here I have questions for you, I have questions for you (I have questions) I have questions for you (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) I have questions for you (fair play, no, fair play, no) I have questions for you (I have questions) I have questions for you How do I fix it? Can we talk? Can we talk? Do I wanna fix it? I have questions for you (I'm afraid of you) Is it my fault? Is it my fault? I have questions..."
