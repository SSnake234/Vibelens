  "lyrics": "I know I messed it up with every other guy I swear you're different and this time I'm gonna try We can start fresh if you'd just let go of the past yeah I don't I don't I don't get it cause I don't judge you like that Can't just love me in pieces gotta love it all You try to make me feel like being humans wrong You got a lot to say about me and my past Well I don't, I don't, I don't get it cause I don't judge you like that Got me runnin' other places in my mind in my mind How could you even say I never try never try And you're acting like I been around with every single guy Got me running other places in my mind in my mind yeah Da da da da da da da da da da da yeah Da da da da da da da da da da da And you're acting like I been around with every single guy Got me running other places in my mind in my mind yeah I know that I could be with any other man But none of them can do it quite the way you can Thought we were stronger why you doubting all the time Well I don't, I don't, I don't get it cause I'm so sweet all the time Our love is effortless, stop acting like you're scared I get down on my knees but you're not playing fair My heart breaks down when you question if you're mine Well I don't, I don't, I don't get it cause I'm so sweet all the time Got me running to places where no body else has gone And I tried to take you with me baby then it went all wrong And I said, \"I'm here to stay but I need to get away\" So I'm running other places in my mind, in my mind, yeah."
