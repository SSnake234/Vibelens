  "lyrics": "In my memory that time First time we met made me miss you And day by day, I felt all of your love warmly came over me When you came, on that day Somebody else was by your side Quickly held your hand, took you away out of me, you went too far from me So many times I’ve seen you smile So many times your tears have fallen down Just tell myself to be strong stand by you Don't love someone not loving you. Love is such a gift Please don’t forget it (Through) thick and thin together Why we want to be apart When love is broken, turn your head around To see who’s been by your side when you’re hurt Love is magical Sometimes we’re like hero They tell me I’m crazy Just follow but no way out Once you’re in love Your heart forgives it all for the past that we came over"
