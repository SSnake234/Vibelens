  "lyrics": "A child arrived just the other day Came to the world in the usual way There were planes to catch, bills to pay He learned to walk while I was away He was talking 'fore I knew it and when he could, he said \"I'm gonna be like you, dad, You know I'm gonna be like you\" The cats in the cradle and the silver spoon Little boy blue and a man on the moon When you comin' home son, I don't know when We'll get together then, You know we'll have a good time then My son turned ten just the other day He said \"Thanks for the ball dad, come on, let's play Could you teach me to throw?\", I said \"Not today I got a lot to do\", he said \"That's OK\" He walked away with a smile on his face, he said \"I'm gonna be like him, yeah, you know I'm gonna be like him\" The cats in the cradle and the silver spoon Little boy blue and a man on the moon When you comin' home son, I don't know when We'll get together then, You know we'll have a good time then Well he came from college just the other day So much like a man I just have to say I'm proud of you, could you sit for a while He shook his head and he said with a smile Wh Wh at I'm feeling like, dad, is to borrow the car keys see you later, can I have them please The cats in the cradle and the silver spoon Little boy blue and a man on the moon When you comin' home son, I don't know when We'll get together then, You know we'll have a good time then I've long since retired, my son moved away I called him up just the other day I'd like to see you, if you don't mind He said: I'd love to, dad, if I could find the time. You see, my new job's hassle and the kids got the flu, but it's sure nice talking to you dad, it was sure nice talking to you. And as I hung up the phone is occurred to me He'd grown up just like me My boy was just like me!"
