  "lyrics": "Here I go Feel better now Here I go It's better now Do you remember when we fell under Did you expect me to reason with thunder I still remember when time was frozen What seemed forever was just a moment Hurry up, hurry up There's no more waiting We're still worth saving Feel the light Shining in the dark of night Remember what we forgot But we're bringing it all back Feel the light Shining like the stars tonight Remember what we forgot But we're bringing it all back"
