Then you came, found me No o ther magic could ever compare There's a room in my heart with the memories we made Took 'em down but they're still in their frames There's no way I could ever for get, mmm For as long as I live and as long as I love I will never not think about you You, mmm. I will never not think about you From the moment I loved, I knew you were the one And no matter what I-I do, ooh, mmm I will never not think about you What we had only comes. Once in a lifetime For the rest of mine, always com pare To the room in my heart with the memories we made Nights on fifth, in between B and A There's no way I could ever for get, mmm There's a room in my heart with the memories we made Took 'em down but they're still in their frames There's no way I could ever for get, mmm For as long as I live and as long as I love I will never not think about you You, mmm. I will never not think about you From the moment I loved, I knew you were the one And no matter what I-I do, ooh, mmm I will never not think about you"
