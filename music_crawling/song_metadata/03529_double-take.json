  "lyrics": "I could say I never dare to think about you in that way But I would be lying And I pretend I’m happy for you when you find some dude to take home But I won’t deny that In the midst of the crowds In the shapes in the clouds I don’t see nobody but you In my rose-tinted dreams Wrinkled silk on my sheets I don’t see nobody but you Boy, you got me hooked on to something Who could say that they saw us coming? Tell me Do you feel the love? Spend the summer of a lifetime with me Let me take you to the place of your dreams Tell me Do you feel the love? Ooh, oo ooh And I could say I never answered those believers inside my head But that’s far from the truth Don’t know what’s come over me It seems like yesterday when I said “We’ll be friends forever” Constellations of stars Murals on city walls I don’t see nobody but you You’re my vice, you’re my muse You’re a nineteenth floor view I don’t see nobody but you Boy, you got me hooked on to something Who could say that they saw us coming? Tell me Do you feel the love? Spend the summer of a lifetime with me Let me take you to the place of your dreams Tell me Do you feel the love? Boy, you got me hooked on to something Who could say that they saw us coming? Tell me Do you feel the love? Spend the summer of a lifetime with me Let me take you to the place of your dreams Tell me Do you feel the love? Do you feel the love? Do you feel the love? Do you feel the love? Do you feel the love?"
