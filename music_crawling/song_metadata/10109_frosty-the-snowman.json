  "lyrics": " Frosty the Snow Man, was a jolly happy soul With a corn-cob pipe and a button nose and two eyes made out of coal. Frosty the Snow Man, is a fairy tale they say He was made of snow but the children know how he came to life one day. There must have been some magic in that old silk hat they found, For when they put it on his head he began to dance around. Oh, Frosty the Snow Man was alive as he could be, And the children say he could laugh and play just the same as you and me. Frosty the Snow Man, ' knew the sun was hot that day, So he said, \"Let's run and we'll have some fun now before I melt away.\" Down to the village, with a broomstick in his hand, Running here and there all around the square, saying \" Catch me if you can.\" He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop, And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler, \" Stop!\" Frosty the Snow Man had to hurry on his way, But he waved good-bye, saying, \" Don't you cry; I'll be back again some day.\""
