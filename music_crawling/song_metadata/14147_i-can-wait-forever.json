  "lyrics": "You look so beautiful today When you're sitting there it's hard for me to look away So i try to find the words that i could say I know distance doesn't matter but you feel so far away And I can't lie Every time I leave my heart turns gray And I wanna come back home to see your face tonight Another day without you with me Is like a blade that cuts right through me But I can wait I can wait forever When you call my heart stops beating When you're gone it won't stop bleeding But I can wait I can wait forever You look so beautiful today It's like every time I turn around I see your face The thing I miss the most is waking up next to you When I look into your eyes Man, I wish that I could stay and I can't lie Every time I leave my heart turns gray And I wanna come back home to see your face tonight Another day without you with me Is like a blade that cuts right through me But I can wait I can wait forever When you call my heart stops beating When you're gone it won't stop bleeding But I can wait I can wait forever I know it feels like forever I guess that's just the price I gotta pay But when I come back home to feel your touch Makes it better Until that day There's nothing else that I can do Another day without you with me Is like a blade that cuts right through me But i can wait I can wait forever (I can wait forever) When you call my heart stops beating When you're gone it won't stop bleeding But I can wait I can wait forever I can wait forever I can wait forever...
