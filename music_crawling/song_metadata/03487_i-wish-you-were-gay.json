  "lyrics": "\"Baby, I don't feel so good\", 6 words you never understood \"I'll never let you go\", 5 words you never said I laugh along like nothing's wrong, 4 days has never felt so long If 3's a crowd and 2 is us, 1 slipped away I just wanna make you feel okay But all you do is look the other way I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay But I just kinda wish you were gay Is there a reason we're not through Is there a 12th step just for you Our conversations are in blue 11 heys 10 fingers tearing out my hair 9 times you never made it fair I ate alone at 7, 6 minutes away How'm I s'posed to make you feel okay When all you do is walk the other way I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay I just kinda wish you were gay To spare my pride To give your lack of interest an explanation I'm not your type Maybe I'm not your preferred sexual and orientation I'm so selfish but you make me feel helpless And I can't stand another day I can't stand another day I just wanna make you feel okay But all you do is look the other way I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay I just kinda wish you were gay I just kinda wish you were gay"
