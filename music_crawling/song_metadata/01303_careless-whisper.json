  "lyrics": "Intro:   x 2 I feel so un- sure as I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor As the music dies, something in your eyes Calls to mind a silver screen and all its sad good- bye I'm never gonna dance again, these guilty feet have got no rhythm Though it's easy to pretend I know you're not a fool I Should've known better than to cheat a friend And waste a chance that I've been given So I'm never gonna dance again the way I danced with you oh oh Time can never mend the careless whisper of a good friend To the heart and mind, Ignorance is kind There's no comfort in the truth, pain is the hole you'll find I'm never gonna dance again, these guilty feet have got no rhythm Though it's easy to pretend I know you're not a fool I Should've known better than to cheat a friend And waste a chance that I've been given So I'm never gonna dance again the way I danced with you oh oh To- night the music seems so loud, I wish that we could lose this crowd Maybe it's better this way, we'd hurt each other with the things we want to say We could have been so good together, we could have lived this dance forever But now who's gonna dance with me, Please stay"
