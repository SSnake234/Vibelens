When all I dream of is your eyes All I long for is your touch And, darling, something tells me that's enough, mm-mm-mm-mm You can say that I'm a fool And I don't know very much But I think they call this  love One smile, one kiss, two lonely hearts is all that it takes Now, baby, you're on my mind, every night, every day Good vibrations getting loud How could this be anything, anything else? When all I dream of is your eyеs All I long for is your touch And, darling, something tells me that's еnough, mm-mm-mm-mm You can say that I'm a fool And I don't know very much But I think they call this love Oh, I think they call this love   What could this be Between you and me? Oh, oh All I dream of is your eyes All I long for is your touch And darling, something tells me, tells me, it's enough You can say that I'm a fool And I don't know very much But I think they call— Oh, I think they call— Yes, I think they call This   love This love"
