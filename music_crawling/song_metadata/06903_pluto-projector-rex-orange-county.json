Seventy-mil projector I can show you everyth ing, yeah And we're on our way to glory Where the show won't ever end And the encore lasts forever And it's time we're due to spend  Spending the years together Growing older every day (Every day) I feel at home when I'm around you And I'll gladly say a gain I hope the encore lasts forever Now there's time for us to spend This right here still feels like a honeymoon When you say my name, nothing's changed I'm still a boy inside my thoughts Am I meant to understand my faults? I don't think so I don't think I'm meant to understand m yself Maybe you do Maybe in time Maybe one day I'll do the s ame ooo OOO ooo (I'll do the same I'll do the same I'll do the same...    I'll do the same as you I'll try and hold it up Soon I hope Or as soon as I'm old enough    (Old enough to underst and)    (Old enough to und ersta nd)         Stay forever, you know more than any one ( Yeah, whoa) And it's you that knows my darkness You could blast me and my secrets Because there's probably just no need"
