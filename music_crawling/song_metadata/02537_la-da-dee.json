I had a little taste And im always for the party anywhere Cause all the girls are looking fine But your the only one on my mind La da dee La la da doo La la da me La la da you La da dee La la da doo Theres only me Theres only you La da dee La la da doo La la da me La la da you La da dee La la da doo When you're gone I'll think of you All these places packed with people But your face is all i see And the musics way to loud But your voice wont let me be. So many pretty girls around They're just dressing to impress but the thought of you alone Has got me smiling I dont know what to say next Yeah im feeling like There is no better place than right by your side. I had a little taste And im always for the party anywhere Cause all the girls are looking fine But your the only one on my mind La da dee La la da doo La la da me La la da you La da dee La la da doo Theres only me Theres only you La da dee La la da doo La la da me La la da you La da dee La la da doo When you're gone I'll think of you (repeat chorus) Ill pretend the night is so beautiful Take a photo with the bros La da dee La da da doo They won't see through my disguise Right here behind my eyes Replaying in my mind L L a dee da im feeling like There is no better place than right by your side. I had a little taste And im always for the party anywhere Cause all the girls are looking fine But your the only one on my mind La da dee La la da doo La la da me La la da you La da dee La la da doo Theres only me Theres only you La da dee La la da doo La la da me La la da you La da dee La la da doo When you're gone I'll think of you (repeat chorus)"
