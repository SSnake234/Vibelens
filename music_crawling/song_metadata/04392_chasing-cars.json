I don't quite know how to say how I feel Those three words are said too much , they're not enough If I lay here , if I just lay here Would you lie with me and just forget the world? Forget what we're told , before we get too old Show me a garden that's bursting into life      All that I am , all that I ever was Is here in your perfect eyes, they're all I can see I don't know where, confused about how as well Just know that these things will never change for us at all Just know that these things will never change for us at all Just know that these things will never change for us at all If I lay here , if I just lay here Would you lie with me and just forget the world?"
