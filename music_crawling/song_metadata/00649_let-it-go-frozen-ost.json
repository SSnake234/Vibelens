  "lyrics": "Let it go let it go Can’t hold you back any- more Let it go let it go Turn my back and slam the door The snow blows white on the mountain tonight Not a footprint to be seen A kingdom of isolation and it looks like I'm the Queen The wind is howling like the swirling storm inside Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried Don't let them in, don't let them see Conceal, don't feel Don't let them know Well, now they know Let it go let it go Can't hold you back any- more Let it go let it go Turn my back and slam the door And here I stand, and here I'll stay Let it go let it go The cold never bothered me anyway It's funny how some distance Makes everything seem small And the fears that once controlled me Can't get to me at all Up here in the cold thin air I finally can breathe I know left a life behind but I'm too relieved to grieve Let it go let it go Can't hold you back any- more Let it go let it go Turn my back and slam the door And here I stand And here I'll stay Let it go let it go The cold never bothered me anyway Standing frozen in the life I've chosen You won't find me, the past is so behind me Buried in the snow Let it go let it go Can’t hold you back any- more Let it go let it go Turn my back and slam the door And here I stand And here I’ll stay Let it go let it go The cold never bothered me anyway"
