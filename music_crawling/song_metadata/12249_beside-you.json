  "lyrics": "Throughout the passing years As all the world seems ever changing We share the smiles and tears Of life, with love that's so far ranging And after all is said and done I'll be the one beside you I'll be your love and loyal friend Until the end, beside you  Each flower bends with time Each leaf descends with every autumn But you and I will find Our love won't die or be forgotten And after all is said and done I'll be the one beside you I'll be your love and loyal friend Until the end, beside you  When you and I are grey When youth has gone and life is dimming I promise that I'll stay Beside you, like we were beginning"
