Take a good look at me now ... Take a good look at me now 'Cause this time next year Imma walk down these halls And show my face for the world to see Gonna see me And Imma call every girl that turned me down And tell 'em now that I'm just too bu sy 'Cause I don't have the time And its funny how my so-called friends Who've always left me alone Are suddenly running into me I'm kickin' in the door now Better get out my way Never really saw me comin' You left with nothing to say This' for every body Who've always put me down I hope you open up your eyes And take a good look at me now ... Take a good look at me now ... Take a good look at me now ... Take a good look at me now ... Take a good look at me now Oh, look at me now Woah, this one is dedicated To all of the people Who said I would be nothing Just look at me now Look at me now Look at me now I'm kickin' in the door now Better get out my way Never really saw me comin' You left with nothing to say This' for every body Who've always put me down I hope you open up your eyes And take a good look at me now ... Take a good look at me now ... Take a good look at me now ... Take a good look at me now ... Take a good look at me now"
