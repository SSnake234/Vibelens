Comin' in to break my heart Make it like an operation Could've 'least waited and I don't play that game I can't get you off my brain So I'm poppin' pills for the pain And as soon as I go wake up And I can't get out of my bed Tears are on my phone but the symptoms in my heart So tell me what's the cure for you (tell me now) 'Cause boy you make me so confused You got me feeling like a psycho, psycho Got me chasin' shots of NyQuil, NyQuil Without you got me dizzy and upset Look what you started Like a psycho (psycho), psycho (psycho) Got me chasin' shots of NyQuil (NyQuil), NyQuil (NyQuil) Without you got me dizzy and upset Look what you started Hey boy I don't see why you can't be with me I'm original, visual, they ain't got nothing on me Yeah, I'm about to blow your spot How should I get rid of you? I can never pull off something I can't be I can never be enough for you to fill your needs But I can't leave And take my love from you, you Tears are on my phone but the symptoms in my heart So tell me what's the cure for you (tell me now) 'Cause boy you make me so confused You got me feeling like a psycho, psycho Got me chasin' shots of NyQuil, NyQuil Without you got me dizzy and upset Look what you started Hey now we’ll be ok. Hey now we’ll be ok Hey now we’ll be ok. Hey now we’ll be ok It’s alright. It’s alright Hey now we’ll be ok. Hey now we’ll be ok Hey now we’ll be ok. Hey now we’ll be ok It’s alright. It’s alright urin jom isanghae Psycho"
