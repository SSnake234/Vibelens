Who's gonna talk to me on the phone Till the sun comes up? Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better We belong together I can't sleep at night When you are on my mind Bobby Womack's on the radio 'If you think you're lonely now' This is too deep, too deep So I turn the dial Trying to catch a break And then I hear Babyface I only think of you And it's breaking my heart I'm trying to keep it together But I'm falling apart I'm feeling all out of my element Trying to figure out Where the hell I went wrong The pain reflected in this song Ain't even half of what Need you back in my life (in my life, in my life), baby When you left I lost a part of me It's still so hard to believe Come back baby please, 'cause We belong together Who else am I gonna lean on When times get rough? Who's gonna talk to me on the phone Till the sun comes up? Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better We belong together When you left I lost a part of me It's still so hard to believe Come back baby please, 'cause We belong together Who else am I gonna lean on When times get rough? Who's gonna talk to me on the phone Till the sun comes up? Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better "
