I see the shadows on my face People have told me, I don't look the same Maybe I lost weight, I'm playing hooky With the best of the best, put my heart on my chest so that you can see it too I'm walking the long road, watching the sky fall The lace in your dress tangles my neck, how do I live? The death of a bachelor, oh oh oh, letting the water fall The death of a bachelor, oh oh oh, seems so fitting for Happily ever after, ooh, how could I ask for more? A lifetime of laughter at the expense of the death of a bachelor. I'm cutting my mind off, It feel like my heart is going to burst Alone at a table for two and I just wanna be served And when you think of me, am I the best you've ever had? Share one more drink with me, smile even though you're sad. I'm walking the long road, watching the sky fall The lace in your dress tangles my neck, how do I live?"
