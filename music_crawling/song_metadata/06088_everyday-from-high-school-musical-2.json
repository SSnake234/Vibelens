  "lyrics": "Once in a lifetime Means there's no second chance So I believe that you and me Should grab it while we can Make it last forever And never give it back It's our turn and I'm loving where we're at Because this moment's really all we have Everyday Of our lives, Wanna find you there, Wanna hold on tight Gonna run While we're young And keep the faith Every day From right now, Gonna use our voices and scream out loud Take my hand Together we Will celebrate,  They say that you should follow And chase down what you dream, But if you get lost and lose yourself What does it really mean? No matter where we're going, It starts from where we are There's more to life when we listen to our hearts And because of you, I've got the strength to start Everyday Of our lives, Wanna find you there, wanna hold on tight Gonna run While we're young And keep the faith. Everyday From right now, Gonna use our voices and scream out loud Take my hand Together we Will celebrate, We're taking it back, It's better like that, We're not gonna lose Every day Of our lives, Wanna find you there, wanna hold on tight Gonna run While we're young And keep the faith Everyday Of our lives, Wanna find you there, wanna hold on tight Gonna run While we're young And keep the faith Everyday From right now, Gonna use our voices and scream out loud Take my hand Together we Will celebrate, Live ev’ry day! Love ev’ry day! Live ev’ryd ay! Love ev’ryd ay! Ev’ ryday! Ev’ ryday! Ev’ ryday! Ev’ ryday! Ev’ ryday! Ev’ ryday! Ev’ ryday! Ev' ryday! Ev’ryday!"
