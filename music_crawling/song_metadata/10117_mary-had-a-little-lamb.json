  "lyrics": "Mary had a little lamb, Little lamb, little lamb, Its fleece was white as snow. Everywhere that Mary went, Mary went, Mary went, The lamb was sure to go. It followed her to school one day School one day, school one day Which was against the rules. It made the children laugh and play, Laugh and play, laugh and play, To see a lamb at school. And so the teacher turned it out, Turned it out, turned it out, But still it lingered near. And waited patiently about, Patiently about, patiently about, Till Mary did appear. \"Why does the lamb love Mary so?\" Love Mary so? Love Mary so? The eager children cry. \"Why, Mary loves the lamb, you know ?\" Loves the lamb, you know, loves the lamb, you know The teacher did reply."
