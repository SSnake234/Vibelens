  "lyrics": "tone Chords:  And the blood will dry underneath my nails and the wind will rise up to fill my sails so you can doubt and you can hate but I know, no matter what it takes home, I'm coming home, tell the world I'm coming home, let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday. I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes, I'm coming home, I'm coming home, tell the world I'm coming Still far away from where I belong but it's always darkest before the dawn so you can doubt and you can hate but I know, no matter what it takes home, I'm coming home, tell the world I'm coming home, let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday. I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes, I'm coming home, I'm coming home, tell the world I'm coming (Repeat)... home"
