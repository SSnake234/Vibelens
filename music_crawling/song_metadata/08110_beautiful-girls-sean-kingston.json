My baby is driving me crazy You're way too beautiful girl That's why it'll never work You'll have me suicidal, suicidal When you say it's over Damn all these beautiful girls They only wanna do your dirt They'll have you suicidal, suicidal When they say it's over It was back in \"99 Oh when I went away And I never thought That we was gonna see each other (see each other) And then I came out Oh I\"m with my girl It came out to be That she wasn\"t the girl for me (girl for me) See it\"s very define, girl But you mush up my mind Oh Lord... My baby is driving me crazy You're way too beautiful girl That's why it'll never work You'll have me suicidal, suicidal When you say it's over Damn all these beautiful girls They only wanna do your dirt They'll have you suicidal, suicidal When they say it's over Now we\"re fussin\" Please tell me why And I don\"t know How to make it better (make it better) You\"re datin\" other guys Oh I can\"t believe I\"m losin\" my mind And I don\"t think it\"s clever (think it\"s clever) You\"re way too beautiful girl That\"s why it\"ll never work You\"ll have me suicidal, suicidal, suicidal..."
