Hurt, I can't shake We've made every mistake Only you know the way that I break If teardrops could be bottled There'd be swimming pools filled by models Told \"that tight dress is what makes you a whore\" If \"I love you\" was a promise Would you break it, if you're honest Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before Idontwanna beyou Idontwanna beyou Idontwanna beyou... anymore"
