Whoa... I try to run away, but Your eyes tell me to stay, oh why Why do we call this love?  Whoa... It seems like we've been losing  control Some-body tell me I'm not alone All I need's a little love in my life All I need's a little love in the dark A little but I'm hoping it might kick start Me and my broken heart I need a little loving tonight Hold me so I'm not falling apart A little but I'm hoping it might kick start Me and my broken heart Maybe some part of you just hates me You pick me up and play me How do we call this love?  Whoa... One time tell me you need me Tonight to make it easy, You lie and say it's all for  love It seems like we've been losing  control Some-body tell me I'm not alone All I need's a little love in my life All I need's a little love in the dark A little but I'm hoping it might kick start Me and my broken heart I need a little loving tonight Hold me so I'm not falling apart A little but I'm hoping it might kick start Me and my broken heart Whoa Whoa Whoa Me and my broken heart Whoa Whoa Whoa Me and my broken heart Piano:    All I need's a little love in my life All I need's a little love in the dark A little but I'm hoping it might kick start Me and my broken heart I need a little loving tonight Hold me so I'm not falling apart A little but I'm hoping it might kick start Me and my broken heart"
