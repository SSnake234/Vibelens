No one waiting by your side You've been runnin' and hiding much too long You know it's just your foolish pride Layla  Got me on my knees, Layla I'm beggin' darling please, Layla  Darling won't you ease my worried mind?   I tried to give you consolation Your old man he let you down Like a fool, I fell in love with you You turned my whole world upside down Make the best of the situation Before I finally go insane Please don't say we'll never find a way Tell me all my love's in vain   (X8)"
