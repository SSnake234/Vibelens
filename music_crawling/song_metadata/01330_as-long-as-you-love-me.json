  "lyrics": "1. Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine I'm leavin' my life in your hands People say I'm crazy and that I am blind Risking it all in a glance. And how you got me blind is still a myste- ry I can't get you out of my head Don't care what is written in your histo- ry As long as you're here with me I don't care who you are, Where you're from What you did as long as you love me Who you are, Where you're from Don't care what you did as long as you love me 2. Every little thing that you have said and done Feels like it's deep within me Doesn't really matter if you're on the run It seems like we're meant to be I've tried to hide it so that no one knows But I guess it shows when you look into my eyes What you did and where you're comin from I don't care, as long as you love me, baby. I don't care who you are, Where you're from What you did as long as you love me Who you are (who you are) Where you're from (where you're from) As long as you love me Who you are As long as you love me What you did (I don't care) As long as you love me"
