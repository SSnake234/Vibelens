You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes I gave you my heart and you made heart break You made my heart break You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room) You made my heart break You made my heart ache (can't take back the love that I gave you) You made my heart break (were made outta plastic, fake) You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room) You made my heart break again (I was tangled up your drastic ways) I still see your s hadows in my room Can't take back the love that I g ave you It's to the point where I lo ve and I hate you And I cannot change you, so I must re place you, oh Easier said than done I thought you were the one Listenin' to my heart in stead of my head You found a nother one But I am the better one I won't let you fo rget me I still see your s hadows in my room Can't take back the love that I g ave you It's to the point where I lo ve and I hate you And I cannot change you, so I must re place you, oh Easier said than done I thought you were the one Listenin' to my heart in stead of my head You found a nother one But I am the better one I won't let you fo rget me Did this shit in the past But I want it to last You were made outta plastic, fake I was tangled up in your drastic ways Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face? Easier said than done I thought you were... ... instead of my head You found another... ... better one"
