It's my word in fantasy I'm living in my living in my dreams You're my heart you're my soul I'm keep it shining every where I go You're my heart you're my soul I'll be holding you forever Staying with you together You're my heart you're my soul Yeah I feel that our love will grow You're my heart you're my soul That's the only thing I really know Let's look for a star and believe my burning heart Feeling all right come and open up your heart I keep the candle burning let your body melt in mine I'm living in my living in my dream"
