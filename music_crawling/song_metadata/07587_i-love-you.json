Say you were tryna make me laugh And nothing has to change today You didn’t mean to say \"I love you\" I lov e you and I don't want to, ooh Up all night On another red-eye I wish we never learned to fly I-I-I Maybe we should just try To tell ourselves a good lie I didn't mean to make you cry, I-I-I Maybe, won't you take it back? Say you were tryna make me laugh And nothing has to change today You didn’t mean to say \"I love you\" I love you and I don't want to, ooh The smile that you gave me Even when you felt like dying We fall apart as it gets dark I'm in your arms in Central Park There's nothing you could do or say I can’t escape the way, I lo ve you I don’t w ant to, but I love you, o oh Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh"
