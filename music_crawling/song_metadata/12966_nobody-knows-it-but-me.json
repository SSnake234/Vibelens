  "lyrics": "I pretend that I'm glad you went away These four walls closing more every day And I'm dying inside And nobody knows it but me Like a clown I put on a show The pain is real even if nobody knows And I'm crying inside And nobody knows it but me Why didn't I say the things I needed to say How could I let my angel get away Now my world is just a-tumblin' down I can say it so clearly but you're nowhere around The nights are lonely the days are so sad and I just keep thinking about the love that we had And I'm missing you And nobody knows it but me I carry a smile when I'm broken in two And I'm nobody without someone like you I'm trembling inside And nobody knows it but me (yeah) I lie awake, it's a quarter past three I'd scream out at night if I thought you'd hear me Yeah, my heart is calling you And nobody knows it but me How blue can I get? You could ask my heart But like a jigsaw puzzle it's been torn all apart A billion words couldn't say just how I feel A million years from now you know I'll be loving you still The nights are lonely the days are so sad and I just keep thinking about the love that we had And I'm missing you And nobody knows it but me Tomorrow morning I'm hittin the dusty road Gonna find you where ever Ever you might go And I'm gonna unload my heart And hope you come back to me The nights are lonely the days are so sad and I just keep thinking about the love that we had And I'm missing you And nobody knows it but me The nights are lonely the days are so sad and I just keep thinking about the love that we had And I'm missing you And nobody knows it but me The nights are lonely the days are so sad and I just keep thinking about the love that we had And I'm missing you And nobody knows it but me"
