The man I love is weak sometimes, but no wor ries I’m here for you If your life is getting cruel, just come back home. Here I am I’ll hold in my arms, you are never alone No matter when I’m here for you Step towards you, where you see the sunshine Where your heart is mine and that’s just all I want. Love is sparking lights bright up the day and our small window Love is the warm and cozy hearts when we spend time to hear the rain Sure, there will be times my heart suffers in pain I still love you and always you! And the first time my heart falling, and the first time I say nothing Dream about where we stay, happily forever Where I wake up with you, kiss you every morning And I love you …………….. The man I love is weak sometimes, but no wor ries I’m here for you If your life is getting cruel, just come back home. Here I am I’ll hold in my arms, you are never alone No matter when I’m here for you Love is sparking lights bright up the day and our small window Love is the warm and cozy hearts when we spend time to hear the rain Sure, there will be times my heart suffers in pain I still love you and always you!"
