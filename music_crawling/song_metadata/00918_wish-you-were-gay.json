  "lyrics": "Tone Baby I don't feel so good, six words you never understoo d \"I'll never let you go\", five words you'll never say (awww) I laugh alone like nothing's wrong, four days has never felt so long If three's a crowd and two was us, one slipped away I just wanna make you feel okay  But all you do is look the other way, mmm-mm   I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay   I just kinda wish you were gay Is there a reason we're not through, is there a twelve step just for you? Our conver sation's all in blue, eleven \"h eys\" (hey, hey, hey, hey) Ten fingers tearing out my hair, nine times you never made it there I ate alone at seven, you were six minutes away To spare my pride, to give your lack of interest an explan ation Don't say I'm not your type, just say that I'm not your pre ferred sexual orient ation I'm so selfish, but you make me feel helpless, yeah And I can't stand another day, stand another day"
