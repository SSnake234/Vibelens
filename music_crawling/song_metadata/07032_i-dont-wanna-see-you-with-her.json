  "lyrics": " It's a small town, word gets around And travels in circles, through hoops over hurdles Everyone's careless, they talk about our mess They don't care how it hurts me, must think it was easy They say you have a new love, I'm happy for you, love I just don't wanna meet her, are you gonna keep her? Cause I don't wanna see you with her, I don't wanna see her face Resting in your embrace, her feet standing in my place I don't wanna see you moved on, I don't think I'm that strong It hasn't been that long, since I was the one in your arms I don't like being sober, that's when it hits me it's over Although it was my choice, I can't shake your calm voice Saying you found one, that makes you feel as strong And helps you through hard times, cause that job was once mine They say you have a new love, I'm happy for you, love I just don't wanna meet her, are you gonna keep her? Cause I don't wanna see you with her, I don't wanna see her face Resting in your embrace, her feet standing in my place I don't wanna see you moved on, I don't think I'm that strong It hasn't been that long, since I was the one in your arms I don't wanna see you with  her I don't wanna see you with  her Cause I don't wanna see you with her, I don't wanna see her face Resting in your embrace, her feet standing in my place I don't wanna see you moved on, I don't think I'm that strong It hasn't been that long, since I was the one in your arms Cause I don't wanna see you with  her"
