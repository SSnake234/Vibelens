  "lyrics": " Sometimes friends have to leave. It's very sad, but true. But this me do believe Friends still a part of you. And if you go away. And live some other place. I will think of you each day. And see your smiley face. And we will always be your friends. No matter where you are. Just around the bend. Or very, very far. Wherever you will go. When you reach your journey's end......... No matter what. We'll always be your friends......... Your very truest bestest friends."
