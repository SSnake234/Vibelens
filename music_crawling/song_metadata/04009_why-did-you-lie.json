  "lyrics": "I saw you going with him to a bar. I saw you, talking to him and having fun. While you said you went to your mom. Why do you wanna do me wrong ? Why did you lie? .......... Why didn’t you just tell me that you wanna break up?. Why did you lie? ......... Don’t come to me and say that you wanna make up!. I don’t know what to say, Take back your tears and go away. I saw enough to know that I’ve been played .......... Still I can’t understand, why did you lie? I saw you holding his hands like they were mine. I saw you kissing his lips, girl you crossed the line. I saw you - you say that you made a big mistake. Then again, it was a risk you did take. Why do you wanna do me wrong?. Why did you lie? ......... Why didn’t you just tell me that you wanna break up?. Why did you lie? ......... Don’t come to me and say that you wanna make up! I don’t know what to say, Take back your tears and go away. I saw enough to know that I’ve been played ............ Still I can’t understand, why did you lie?........"
