I'm leavin' to- day 'cause I've gotta do what's best for me. you'll be okay I've got to move on and be who I am I just don't be- long here I hope you under- stand we might find our place in this world some- day but at least for now, I gotta go my own way. what about us? what about ev'rything we've been through? what about trust? you know I never wanted to hurt you. and what about me? what am I supposed to do? I gotta leave but I'll miss you. uuuuuh so... I've got to move on and be who I am. I just don't belong here I hope you under- stand. we might find our place in this World some- day, but at least for now, I've got to move on and be who I am. I just don't belong here I hope you under- stand. we might find our place in this World some- day, but at least for now, I gotta go my own way.  "
