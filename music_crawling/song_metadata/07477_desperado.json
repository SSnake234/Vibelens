  "lyrics": "Tông : Desper ado , why don't you come to your senses ? You been out ridin' fences for so long now Oh, you're a hard one, I know that you got your reasons , These things that are pleasin' you can hurt you somehow Don't you draw the queen of diamonds boy, She'll beat you if she's able, You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet Now it seems to me some fine things have been laid upon your table But you only want the ones you can't get Desperado , oh you ain't gettin' no younger, Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home And freedom, oh freedom, well, that's just some people talkin' Your prison is walkin' through this world all alone Don't your feet get cold in the winter time ? The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine It's hard to tell the night time from the day You're losin' all your highs and lows Ain't it funny how the feelin' goes away Des pera do , why don't you come to your senses Come down from your fences, open the gate It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you You better let somebody love you, let somebody love you You better let somebody love you before it's too late"
