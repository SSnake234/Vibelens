Son of God, love's pure light Radiant beams from Thy holy face With the dawn of re deeming grace Jesus Lord, at Thy birth Jesus Lord, at Thy birth Silent night, holy night! Shepherds quake at the sight Heavenly hosts from heaven above Guardian Angels sing Alleluia! Christ, our Saviour is born Christ, our Saviour is born"
