No more sighing in the breast. I'm sorry for what I did. I did what my body told me to. I didn't mean to do you harm. Everytime I pin down what I think I want it slips away. The goal slips away ........... Smell you on my hands for days. I can't wash away your scent. If I'm a dog then you're a bitch ........... I guess you're as real as me. Maybe I can live with that. Maybe I need fantasy. Life of chasing butterfly. I'm sorry for what I did. I did what my body told me to. I didn't mean to do you harm. Everytime I pin down what I think I want it slips away. The goal slips away ......... I told you I would return. When the robin makes his nest. But I ain't never coming back ........... I'm sorry........I'm sorry ...........I'm s.o .r. r. y."
