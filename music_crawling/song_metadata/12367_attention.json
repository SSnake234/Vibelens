  "lyrics": "Girl, would it kill you just to throw a little bit of attention? If I hurt you, I'm afraid god's gonna teach me a lesson Now would you hate me if I said good bye So quick you could eat my dust? Now would you hate me if I ran like hell In the wind from dawn 'til dusk? When you cry, you waste your time Over boys you never liked Can you not be so obvious? So keep it light So keep it light No, I thought I'd vocalized my troubles But nobody will listen, hm I know I'm cryptic, and I'm weird That shit comes off as indiffrent I don't wanna die so young Got so much to do I don't smile for the camera Only smile for you Smile for you Now would you hate me if I said goodbye So quick you could eat my dust? Now would you hate me if I ran like hell In the wind from dawn 'til dusk? When you cry, you waste your time Over boys you never liked Can you not? "
