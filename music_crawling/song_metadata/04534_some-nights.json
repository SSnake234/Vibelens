  "lyrics": " Some nights I stay up cashing in my Some nights I call it a draw. Some nights I wish that my lips could build a castle. Some nights I wish they'd just fall off But I still wake up, I still see your ghost. Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh. What do I stand for? What do I stand for? Most nights, I don't know anymore     This is it, boys. This is war. What are we waiting for? Why don't we break the rules already? I was never one to believe the hype. Save that for the black and white. I try twice as hard and I'm half as liked, But here they come again to jack my style And that's alright I found a martyr in my bed tonight. She stops my bones from wondering Just who I am, who I am, who I am. Yeah, oh who am I mmmm mmmmm Some nights I wish that this all would end 'Cause I could use some friends for a change. And some nights I'm scared you'll forget me again. Some nights, I always win (I always win) But I still wake up, I still see your ghost. Oh Lord, I still don't know what I stand for, oh. What do I stand for? What do I stand for? Most nights, I don't know So this is it? I sold my soul for this? Washed my hands of that for this? No. When I see stars, when i see stars, that's all they are. When I hear songs, they sound like a swan. So come on. Oh, come on. Oh, come on. Oh, come on! That is it, guys, that is all. Five minutes in and I'm bored again. Ten years of this, and I'm not sure if anybody understands. This is not one for the folks back home. I'm sorry to leave, Mom, I had to go. Who the fuck wants to die alone all dried up in the desert sun? My heart is breaking for my sister And the con that she called love. But when I look into my nephew's eyes, Man, you wouldn't believe The most amazing things that can come from. Som Som e te rr ib le n igh ts.  The other night, you wouldn't believe the dream I just had about you and me I called you up, but we'd both agree It's for the best you didn't listen It's for the best we get our distance."
