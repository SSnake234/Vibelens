I [C]call your [G]number the line [Am]ain't free I like to tell you come to me A night without you seems like a lost dream Love I can't tell you how I feel Always somewhere......... . Miss you where I've been I'll be back to love you again. Always somewhere........... Miss you where I've been I'll be back to love you again......... . Another morning another place . The only day off is far away But every city has seen me in the end And brings me to you again......... . "
