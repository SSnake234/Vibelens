  "lyrics": "  You are somebody that I don't know But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón And I'm just like \"Damn, it's 7 a.m.\" Say it in the street, that's a knock-out But you say it in a tweet, that's a cop-out And I'm just like \" Hey, are you okay?\" And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression but I've learned the lesson That stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun And snakes and stones never broke my bones So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh You need to calm down, you're being too loud And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown? You need to calm down You are somebody that we don't know But you're comin' at my friends like a missile Why are you mad, when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD) Sunshine on the street at the parade But you would rather be in the dark ages Makin' that sign, must've taken all night You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate 'Cause shade never made anybody less gay So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh You need to calm down, you're being too loud And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh You need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown? You need to calm down Comparing all the girls who are killin' it But we figured you out, we all know now We all got crowns, you need to calm down oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh You need to calm down(You need to calm dowm) you're being too loud (You’re being too loud) And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh You need to just stop (Can you stop) Like can you just not step on our gown? You need to calm down"
