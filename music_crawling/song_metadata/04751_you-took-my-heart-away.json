  "lyrics": "Staring at the moon so blue Turning all my thoughts to you I was without hopes or dreams I tried to dull an inner scream but you Saw me through Walking on a path of air See your faces every where As you melt this heart of stone You take my hand to guide me home and now I'm in love You took my heart away When my whole world was gray You gave me everything and a little bit more And when it's cold at night And you sleep by my side You become the meaning of my life Living in a world so cold You are there to warm my soul You came to mend a broken heart You gave my life a brand new start and now I'm in love You took my heart away When my whole world was gray You gave me everything and a little bit more And when it's cold at night And you sleep by my side You become the meaning of my life Holding your hand I won't fear to morrow Here were we stand We'll never be a lone You took my heart away When my whole world was gray You gave me everything and a little bit more And when it's cold at night And you sleep by my side You become the meaning of my life You become the meaning of my life You become the meaning You become the meaning ...of my life"
