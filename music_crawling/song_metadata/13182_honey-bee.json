Yes, you did You didn't have to say my name Ignite my circuits and start a flame But you did Oh, Turpentine erase me whole (Cause I) don't want to live my life alone (Well I) was waiting for you all my life Oh Why Ho-ney- Beeeeeeee eeeeeeeeeeee eeeeeee Ho-ney- Beeeeeeee eeeeeeeeeeee eeeeeee You didn't have to smile at me Your grin's the sweetest that I've ever seen But you did. Yes you did You didn't have to offer your hand Cause since I've kissed it I am at your command But you did Oh, Turpentine erase me whole (I don't) want to live my life alone (I was) waiting for you all mylife Oh Why Ho-ney- Beeeeeeee eeeeeeeeeeee eeeeeee Ho-ney- Beeeeeeee eeeeeeeeeeee eeeeeee Hello Goodbye, Twas nice to know you How I find myself without you That I'll never know I let myself go Hello Goodbye, I'm rather crazy And I never thought I was crazy But what do I know? I let myself go Ho-ney- Beeeeeeee eeeeeeeeeeee eeeeeee Ho-ney- Beeeeeeee eeeeeeeeeeee eeeeeee Hello Goodbye, Twas nice to know you How I find myself without you That I'll never know I let myself go Hello Goodbye, I'm rather crazy And I never thought I was crazy But what do I know? I let myself go"
