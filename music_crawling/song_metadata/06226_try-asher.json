  "lyrics": "If i walk would you run If i stop would you come If i say you're the one would you believe me If i ask you to stay would you show me the way Tell me what to say so you don't leave me The world is catching up to you While your running away to chase your dream It's time for us to make a move cause we are asking one another to change And maybe i'm not ready But i'm trying for your love I can hide up above I will try for your love We've been hiding enough It's time for us to face the truth cause we are coming to each other to change But i'm trying for your love I can hide up above I will try for your love We've been hiding enough"
