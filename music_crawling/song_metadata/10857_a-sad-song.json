  "lyrics": "When you got nothing to do. If the earth still moving People doing best at what they do you still waste your time to listen to this song. It means that you got nothing to do. If the sky still blue then try to write Some bullshits to get through, bro 'Bout something no one else will do Then make it like a sad song. Let's fucking make a sad songgg a really really sad song. If it sounds bad, it's ok, go on Then just name it a sad song. Because it is a SAD SONG A very very sad song. Even if things go wrong you just got something to do When you got nothing to do. Deep inside you knew you screwed up too much When it's out of blue. If this story's written down for you Then make it like a sad song. Let's fucking make a sad songgg A really really sad song. If it sounds bad, it's ok, go on Then just name it a sad song. Because it is a SAD SONG A very very sad song. Even if things go wrong you just got something When youuuu don't know what to do When no one needs you I'll be with you We flipped the dimes and we fucked it up so many times at least we tried at least we tried Then make it like a sad song. Let's fucking make a sad songgg A really really sad song. If it sounds bad, it's ok, go on Then just name it a sad song. Because it is a SAD SONG A very very sad song. Even if things go wrong you just got something to do"
