When all is said and done (Hey now, put your hands in the air, I'ma go through your stuff) Where'd the love go? Put the running into run But I never met a girl I could trust You're sayin' those words like you hate me now (wo-oah) Our house is burning when you're raisin' hell (wo-oah) Here in the ashes your soul cries out (a-a-ah) But don't be afraid of these thunderclouds These thunderclouds, oh, no These thunderclouds, oh, no, no All I need is love (da-dum, dum, dum) All I need is a word (da-dum, dum, dum) All I need is us (da-dum, dum, dum) You turned nouns into verbs, to verbs Where'd the love go? When all is said and done (Hey now, put your hands in the air, I'ma go through your stuff) Where'd the love go? Put the running into run But I never met a girl I could trust You're sayin' those words like you hate me now (wo-oah) Our house is burning when you're raisin' hell (wo-oah) Here in the ashes your soul cries out (a-a-ah) But don't be afraid of these thunderclouds These thunderclouds, oh, no These thunderclouds, oh, no, no These thunderclouds (woah-ah-oh-ah-oh- oh), these thunderclouds (ah ah-ah) These thunderclouds (ah-oh-oh-oh- oh), ohhh oh-oh-oh-oh ohhhhhh"
