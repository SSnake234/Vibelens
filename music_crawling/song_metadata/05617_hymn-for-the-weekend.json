Life is a drink, and love's a drug Oh now I think I must be miles up When I was hurt, withered, dried up You came to rain a flood So drink from me, drink from me When I was so thirsty Pour on a symphony Now I just can't get enough Put your wings on me, wings on me When I was so heavy Pour on a symphony When I'm lower, lower, lower, low I-Oh- ah-oh- ah I'm feeling drunk and high So high, so high I-Oh- ah-oh- ah I'm feeling drunk and high So high, so high   Ohhhhh, angels sent from up above I feel you coursing through my blood Life is a drink, your love's about To make the stars come out Put your wings on me, wings on me When I was so heavy Pour on a symphony When I'm lower, lower, lower, low I-Oh- ah-oh- ah I'm feeling drunk and high So high, so high I-Oh- ah-oh- ah I'm feeling drunk and high So high, so high I-Oh- ah-oh- ah I'm feeling drunk and high So high, so high I-Oh- ah-oh- ah I'm feeling drunk and high So high, so high Then we'll shoot across the sky Then we'll shoot across the ... Then we'll shoot across the sky Then we'll shoot across the ... Then we'll shoot across the sky Then we'll shoot across the... "
