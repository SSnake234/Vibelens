  "lyrics": "At first, I didn't seem to care 'bout love But suddenly, you came to me, following me a round I thought I told you to stop staring now Why don't you listen to me? Stop calling me at night But when we say \"bye\" I kinda wish that we'd stay up all night (Now, I miss you all the time) Oh, it's obvious to my friends That when they see you smiling I go crazy for you Cause you're the one that I like, I can't deny every night you're on my mind So, if I call you tonight Will you pick up and give me your time? Miss you every night, miss you all the time No, I don't even know where to start Cause you're the one that I like, I can't deny Every thing I feel in side Will you tell me I'm the one The one that in side of your heart Used to brush aside, now I can't deny That, baby, you're my special one cause you're the one that I like You mean a lot to me Cause you have made me be lieve How love makes anything Better than they used to be I'm not like this before You make me wish for more Oh, when you pass me by Girl, you give me butter flies Cause every thing slows down in time ( Oh) I don't know what to say Cause, girl, when you smile I'd fall for it again and a gain Cause you're the one that I like, I can't deny every night you're on my mind So, if I call you tonight Will you pick up and give me your time? Miss you every night, miss you all the time No, I don't even know where to start Cause you're the one that I like, I can't deny Every thing I feel in side Will you tell me I'm the one The one that in side of your heart Used to brush aside, now I can't deny That, baby, you're my special one cause you're the one that I like"
