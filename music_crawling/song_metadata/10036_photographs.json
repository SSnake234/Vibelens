It should have been me and you It could have been you and me Boy you broke my heart and now I’m standing here It should have been me and you It could have been you and me Now all I got are these photographs All I’ve got, all I’ve got. All I’ve got are these photographs All I’ve got, all I’ve got. Is nothing without you, you, you. Got nothing without you, you, you Got nothing without you Now baby it’s killing me I’m saying it’s killing me The fact that you went around Baby I’m falling down I need me a remedy Been looking for remedies Baby I’m hurting now I need you to be around I know you’re a better man When I was your girl This land is a better land When you’re in my world Today will be better babe If it were like yesterday So happy and lovely hey, hey, hey I got them pictures back when I was rocking Calvin Klein"
