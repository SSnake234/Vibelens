Remember the first day when I saw your face Remember the first day when you smiled at me You stepped to me and then you said to me I was the woman you dreamed about Remember the first day when you called my house Remember the first day when you took me out We had butterflies although we tried to hide it And we both had a beautiful night. Pre: The way we held each others hand, The way we talked, the way we laughed It felt so good to find true love I knew right then and there you were the one ohhhhh Chorus: I know that he loves me cause he told me so I know that he loves me cause his feelings show When he stares at me you see he cares for me You see how he is so deep in love I know that he loves me cause its obvious I know that he loves me cause its me he trusts And he's missing me if he's not kissing me And when he looks at me his brown eyes tell his soul 2. Remember the first day, the first day we kissed Remember the first day we had an argument We apologized and then we compromised And we've haven't argued since Remember the first day we stopped playing games Remember the first day you fell in love with me It felt so good for you to say those words Cause I felt the same way too. Bridge: I'm so happy, so happy that your in my life And baby now that your apart of me You've showed me Showed me the true meaning of love (the true meaning of love) And I know he loves me. Change key up ½ tone to ---------- Chorus: I know that he loves me cause he told me so I know that he loves me cause his feelings show When he stares at me you see he cares for me You see how he is so deep in love I know that he loves me cause its obvious I know that he loves me cause its me he trusts And he's missing me if he's not kissing me And when he looks at me his brown eyes tell his soul He looks at me and his brown eyes tell his soul"
