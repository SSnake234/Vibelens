  "lyrics": " Do you want me or do you not? I heard one thing, now I'm hearing another Dropped a pin to my parking spot The bar was hot, it's 2am, it feels like summer  Happiness is a butterfly, try to catch it like every night It escapes from my hands into moonlight  Everyday is a lullaby, hum it on the phone like every night And sing it for my babies on the tour life, ah-ah ah If he's a serial killer, then what's the worst That could happen to a girl who's already hurt, I'm already hurt If he's as bad as they say, then I guess I'm cursed Looking into his eyes, I think he's already hurt, he's already hurt I said, \"Don't be a jerk, don't call me a taxi\" Sitting in your sweatshirt, crying in the backseat Ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, I just wanna dance with you Hollywood and Vine, Black Rabbit in the alley I just wanna hold you tight down the Avenue-hoo-hoo hoo, I just wanna dance with you I just wanna dance, baby, I just wanna dance Dance, baby, I just wanna dance Left the canyon, drove to the club I was one thing, now I'm being another Go down to Sunset in my truck I'll pick you up if you're in town, I'm coming, ah-ah ha-ha  Happiness is a butterfly, we should catch it while dancing I lose myself in the music, ba-—by  Everyday is a lullaby, try to catch it like lightning I sing it into my music, I'm cra-zy If he's a serial killer, then what's the worst That could happen to a girl who's already hurt, I'm already hurt If he's as bad as they say, then I guess I'm cursed Looking into his eyes, I think he's already hurt, he's already hurt I said, \"Don't be a jerk, don't call me a taxi\" Sitting in your sweatshirt, crying in the backseat Ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, I just wanna dance with you Hollywood and Vine, Black Rabbit in the alley I just wanna hold you tight down the Avenue-hoo-hoo hoo, I just wanna dance with you I just wanna dance, baby, I just wanna dance Dance, baby, I just wanna dance"
