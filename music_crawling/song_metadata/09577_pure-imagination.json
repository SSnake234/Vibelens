There's nothing to it There is no life I know to compare with pure imagination Living there, you'll be free If you truly wish to be If you want to view paradise simply look around and view it Anything you want to, do it Wanna change the world? There's nothing to it There is no life I know to compare with pure imagination Living there, you'll be free If you truly wish to be"
