  "lyrics": "Keep watching over Durin's son If this is to end in fire Then we shall all burn together Watch the flames climb high into the night Calling out father, stand by and we will Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side And if we should die tonight Then we should all die together Raise a glass of wine for the last time Calling out father, prepare as we will Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side Desolation comes upon the sky Now I see fire, inside the mountain I see fire, burning the trees And I see fire, hollowing souls I see fire, blood in the breeze Oh, should my people fall Then surely I'll do the same Confined in mountain halls We got too close to the flame Calling out father hold fast and we will Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side Desolation comes upon the sky Now I see fire, inside the mountain I see fire, burning the trees And I see fire, hollowing souls I see fire, blood in the breeze And I hope that you'll remember me And if the night is burning I will cover my eyes For if the dark returns then My brothers will die And as the sky's falling down It crashed into this lonely town And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming out Now I see fire, inside the mountain I see fire, burning the trees And I see fire, hollowing souls I see fire, blood in the breeze I see fire, oh you know I saw a city burning ( fire) I see fire, feel the heat upon my skin ( fire) And I see fire, oooooo ( fire) And I see fire burn auburn on the mountain side"
