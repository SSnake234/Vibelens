Though we've got to say good- bye For the summer Darling, I promise you this I'll send you all my love Every day in a letter Sealed with a kiss 2. Yes it's gonna be cold, lonely summer But I'll fill the emptin ess I'll send you all my dreams Everyd ay in a letter Sealed with a kiss I'll see you in the sun light I'll hear your voice every where I'll run to tenderly hold you But, Darlin' you won't be there I don't wanna say good- bye For the summer Knowing the love we'll miss Let us make a pledge To meet in Sep tember And seal it with a kiss Sealed with a kiss Sealed with a kiss Sealed with a kiss"
