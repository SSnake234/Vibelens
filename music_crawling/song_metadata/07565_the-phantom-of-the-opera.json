  "lyrics": "In sleep he sang to me In dreams he came That voice he calls to me and speaks my name And do I dream again for now I find The Phantom of the Opera is there Inside my mind  Sing once again with me Our strange duet My power over you grows stronger yet And though you turn from me to glance be hind The Phantom of the Opera is there Inside your mind. Those who have seen your face Draw back in fear I am the mask you wear It's me they hear... Your/My spirit and my/your voice in one com bined The Phantom of the Opera is there/here Inside my/your mind He's there, the phantom of the opera! Be ware, the phantom of the opera! In all your fantasies, you always knew that man and mystery Were both in you And in this laby rinth where night is blind the Phantom of the Opera is there/here, inside my/your mind The angel of music! He's there, the phantom of the opera Sing, my Angel of Music"
