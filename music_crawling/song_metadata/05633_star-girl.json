Ooh ooh ooh ooh Go surf in the sun as it starts to rise Ooh ooh ooh ooh Woahhh your gravity ’s making me dizzy Girl I gotta tell you I feel much better Make a little love in the moonlight Hey there’s nothing on earth that could save us When I fell in love with ur-anus Coz it makes no sense at all Houston we've got a problem And ground control couldn’t stop them You never asked me to stay Ooh ooh ooh ooh So wouldn’t you like to come with me? Ooh ooh ooh ooh Go surf in the sun as it starts to rise Ooh ooh ooh ooh Woahhh your gravity’s making me dizzy Girl I gotta tell you I feel much better Make a little love in the moonlight Fly away Watch the night turn into day Dance on the Milky Way Melt me with your eyes the star girl rules the sky One, two, one two three four!  Verse 3 I’m looking up for my star girl I guess I’m stuck in this mad mad world But you’re a million miles away Ooh ooh ooh ooh So wouldn’t you like to come with me? Ooh ooh ooh ooh Go surf in the sun as it starts to rise Ooh ooh ooh ooh Yeah wouldn’t you like to come with me? Girl I gotta tell you I feel much better I can’t get enough of you Galaxy defenders, stay forever I’ll never get enough of you"
