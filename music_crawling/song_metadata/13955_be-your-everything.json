Cause Im on a mission I dont wanna share I want you all to myself right now I just wanna scream it out Ill be your shelter Ill be your storm Ill make you shiver Ill keep you warm Whatever weather Well baby Im yours Ill be your forever, Be your fling Baby I will be your everything No matter what you  do Ill be there for you Every time you close your eyes I will be by your side Want you to wear my ring Wont you tell me Im your everything Ill be your shelter Ill be your storm Ill make you shiver Ill keep you warm Whatever weather Well baby Im yours Ill be your forever, Be your fling Baby I will be your everything"
