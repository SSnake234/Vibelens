When the wicked carried us away in cap tivity Re quired from us a song Now how shall we sing the lord's song in a strange land When the wicked carried us away in cap tivity Re quired from us a song Now how shall we sing the lord's song in a strange land Let the words of our mouth and the medi tations of our heart be ac ceptable in thy sight here tonight Let the words of our mouth and the medi tations of our heart be ac ceptable in thy sight here tonight By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down ye-eah we wept, when we remembered Zion. By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down ye-eah we wept, when we remembered Zion."
