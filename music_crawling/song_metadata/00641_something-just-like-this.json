I'm not looking for somebody with some superhuman gifts Some superhero , some fairytale bliss Just something I can turn to, somebody I can kiss I want something just like this, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo Oh I want something just like this, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo Oh I want something just like this   I want something just like this   I've been reading books of old, the legends and the myths The testaments they told, the moon and its eclipse And Superman unrolls, a suit before he lifts But I'm not the kind of person that it fits She said, where' d you wanna go, how much you wanna risk? I'm not looking for somebody with some superhuman gifts Some superhero , some fairytale bliss Just something I can turn to, somebody I can miss I want something just like this   I want something just like this   Oh I want something just like this, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-oo Oh I want something just like this, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-oo Where' d you wanna go, how much you wanna risk? I'm not looking for somebody with some superhuman gifts Some superhero , some fairytale bliss Just something I can turn to, somebody I can kiss I want something just like this"
