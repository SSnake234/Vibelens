Girl, it’s with you I belong, Somebody needs you, Like never before. Somebody wants your love, Baby open the door. Don’t you leave me alone, Don’t you turn out the light. Somebody wants you (wants you), I’ve been thinking, We should be talking it through. Ooohh...yeah... You must believe me, I’ll make it all up to you, yeah. (Make it, up to you babe) Cause now I know better, To hurt you was wrong. Girl, it’s with you I belong, Somebody needs you, Like never before. Somebody wants your love, Baby open the door. Don’t you leave me alone, Don’t you turn out the light. Somebody wants you ( wants you),"
