Ale, ale, ale! Go, go, go! A le, ale, ale! Tonight's the night we're gonna celebrate The cup of life! A le, ale, a le! The cup of life, it's do or die It's here, it's now, turn up the lights Push it along, go, go, goal And when you feel that heat, the world is at your feet No one can hold you down if you really want it Here we go! Ale, ale, ale! Go, go, go! A le, ale, ale! Tonight's the night we're gonna celebrate The cup of life! A le, ale, a le!"
