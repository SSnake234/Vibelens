  "lyrics": "Chord:     We're all bored We're all so tired of everything We wait for trains that just aren't coming We show off our different scarlet letters Trust me mine is better We're so young that we're on the run to ruin We play dumb But we know exactly what we're doing We cry tears Of mascara in the bathroom Honey life is just a classroom Aahaahaa h! 'Cause baby I could build a castle Out of all the bricks, they threw at me And every day it's like battle But every night with us is like an dream Baby, we're the new romantics Come on, come on along with me Heartbreak is the national anthem We sing it proudly We are too busy dancing To get knocked off our feet Baby, we're the new romantics The best people in life are free We're all here The lights and noise are blinding We hang back It's all in the timing It's poker, he can't see in my face But I'm about to play my ace We need love, but all we want is danger We team up and switch sides like a record changer The rumors are terrible and cruel But honey most of them are true Aahaahaa h! Cause baby I could build a castle Out of all the bricks, they threw at me And every day it's like battle But every night with us is like an dream Baby, we're the new romantics Come on, come on along with me Heartbreak is the national anthem We sing it proudly We are too busy dancing To get knocked off our feet Baby, we're the new romantics The best people in life are free, oh So come on, come on along with me The best people in life are free Please take my hand And please take me dancing And please leave me stranded it's so romantic (It's so romantic) Aahaahaa h! Cause baby I could build a castle Out of all the bricks, they threw at me And every day it's like battle But every night with us is like an dream Baby, we're the new romantics Come on, come on along with me Heartbreak is the national anthem We sing it proudly We are too busy dancing To get knocked off our feet Baby, we're the new romantics The best people in life are free, oh So come on, come on along with me The best people in life are free"
