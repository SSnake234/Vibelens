  "lyrics": "I'd never gone with the wind Just let it flow Let it take me where it wants to go Till you open the door there's so much more I've never seen it before I was trying to fly but I couldn't find wings But you came along and you changed everything You lift my feet off the ground You spin me around You make me crazier, crazier Feels like I'm falling and I I'm lost in your eyes You make me crazier, crazier, crazier I watched from a distance as you Made life your own Every sky was your own kind of blue And I wanted to know how that would feel And you made it so real You showed me something that I couldn't see You opened my eyes and you made me believe You lift my feet off the ground You spin me around You make me crazier, crazier Feels like I'm falling and I I'm lost in your eyes You make me crazier, crazier, crazier [A ]B ab y you [Bm]showed me what [G]living is for I don't want to hide anymore You lift my feet off the ground You spin me around You make me crazier, crazier Feels like I'm falling and I I'm lost in your eyes You make me crazier, crazier, crazier Crazier, crazier"
