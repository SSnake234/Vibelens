  "lyrics": " I hear your heart, cry for love. But you won’t let me make it right. You were hurt, but I decided, That you were worth the fight Every night, you lock up. You won’t let me come inside. But the look, in your eyes. In your heart, in your heart, in your heart. I can tell you can fit one more. In your heart, in your heart, in your heart. I don’t care who was there before. I, hear your heart cry for love, Then you act like there’s no room, Room for me, or anyone. Don’t disturb is all I see. Close the door, turn the key. On everything that we could be. If loneliness would move out, In your heart, in your heart, in your heart, Ooooh. In your heart, in your heart, in your heart. Oooh. This ain’t the Heartbreak Hotel, Even though I know it well. Those no shows, they sure tell, In the way you hold yourself. Don’t you fret, should you get, Give me a chance I’d make a, Permanent reservation. In your heart, in your heart, in your heart, I can tell you can fit one more. Open up make a brand new start, I don’t care who’s stayed before. I, hear your heart cry for love, Then you act like there’s no room, Room for me, or anyone. Don’t disturb is all I see. Close the door, turn the key. On everything that we could be. If loneliness would move out, In your heart, in your heart, in your heart, In your heart, in your heart, in your heart. I, hear your heart cry for love, Then you act like there’s no room, Room for me, or anyone. Don’t disturb is all I see. Close the door, turn the key. On everything that we could be. If loneliness would move out, In your heart, in your heart, in your heart, In your heart, in your heart, in your heart."
