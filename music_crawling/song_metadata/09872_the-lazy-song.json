Ooh hoo ooh hoo Hoo ooh ooh, Nothing at all Ooh hoo ooh hoo Hoo ooh ooh Tomorrow I wake up, do some P90X With a really nice girl have some really nice sex And she's gonna scream out, \"this is great\" (Oh my god this is great) I might mess around and get my college degree I bet my old man will be so proud of me I'm sorry pops you just have to wait To day I don't feel like doing anything I just wanna lay in my bed Don't feel like picking up my phone So leave a message at the tone Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything. No I ain't gonna comb my hair Cause I ain't going any where No no no no no no no no nooo I'll just strut in my birthday suit And let everything hang loose Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeahhh. To day I don't feel like doing anything I just wanna lay in my bed Don't feel like picking up my phone So leave a message at the tone Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything. Ooh hoo ooh hoo Hoo ooh ooh, Nothing at all Ooh hoo ooh hoo Hoo ooh ooh Nothing at all"
