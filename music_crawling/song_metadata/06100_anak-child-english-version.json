  "lyrics": "When you were born into this world Your mom and dad saw a dream fulfilled Dream comes true, the answer to their prayer You were to them a special child You gave 'em joy everytime you smiled Each time you cry, they're at your side to care Child you don't know You'll never know how far they'd go To give you all their love can give To see you through and God it's true They'd die for you if they must, to see you here How many seasons came and went So many years have now been spent For time ran fast And now at last you're strong Now what has gotten over you You seem to hate your parents too Speak out your mind Why do you find them wrong? Child you don't know You'll never know how far they'd go To give you all their love can give To see you through and God it's true They'd die for you if they must, to see you near And now your path has gone astray Child you ain'tsure what to do or say You're so alone, no friends are on your side And child you now break down in tears Let them cry the way your tear Where must you go, their arms stay open wide Child you don't know You'll never know how far they'd go To give you all their love can give To see you through and God it's true They'd die for you if they must, to see you here Child you don't know You'll never know how far they'd go To give you all their love can give To see you through and God it's true They'd die for you if they must, to see you near"
