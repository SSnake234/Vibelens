You're insecure Don't know what for You're turning heads when you walk through the door Don't need make-up To cover up Being the way that you are is enough Everyone else in the room can see it Everyone else but you Baby you light up my world like nobody else The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed But you when smile at the ground it aint hard to tell You don't know oh oh You don't know you're beautiful If only you saw what I can see You'll understand why I want you so desperately Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe You don't know oh oh You don't know you're beautiful oh oh But that's what makes you beautiful 2. So c-come on You got it wrong to prove I'm right I put it in a song I don't why You're being shy and turn away when I look into your eyes Everyone else in the room can see it Everyone else but you Baby you light up my world like nobody else The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed But you when smile at the ground it aint hard to tell You don't know oh oh You don't know you're beautiful Na na na na na na na na Na na na na na na na Na na na na na na na na Na na na na na na na Baby you light up my world like nobody else the way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed but you when smile at the ground it aint hard to tell You don't know oh oh You don't know you're beautiful"
