  "lyrics": "There's something in your eyes that's far too revealing Why must it be like this a love without feelin' Something's wrong with you I know I see it in your eyes Believe me when I say It's gonna be okay I told you from the start I won't be demanding If you have a change of heart I'll be understanding When love becomes a broken heart and dreams begin to die Believe me when I say We'll work it out some way I'll never try to hold you back. I wouldn't try controlling you If it's what you want - It's what I want I want what's best for you And if there's something else that you're looking for I'll be the first to help you try Believe me when I say: it's hard to say good bye. We've Emlost that loving touch we used to feel so much I try to hide the truth that's in my eyes But when I feel we're not in love, I know I'm losing you Be lieve me when I say We'll work it out some way I'll never try to hold you back. I wouldn't try controlling Cyou If it's what you want - It's what I want I want what's best for you And if there's something else that you're looking for I'll be the first to help you try Believe me when I say: it's hard to say good bye.  Don't say goodbye  If it's what you want - It's what I want I want what's best for you I'll never try to hold you back. I wouldn't try controlling you If it's what you want - It's what I want I want what's best for you And if there's something else that you're looking for I'll be the first to help you try Believe me when I say: it's hard to say good bye. I'll never try to hold you back. I wouldn't try controlling you If it's what you want - It's what I want I want what's best for you And if there's something else that you're looking for I'll be the first to help you try Believe me when I say: it's hard to say good bye."
