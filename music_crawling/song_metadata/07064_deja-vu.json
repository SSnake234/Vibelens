Almost say my name 'Cause let's be honest we kinda do sound the same Another ac tress I hate to think that I was just your type I bet that she knows Billy Joel 'Cause you played her Uptown Girl You're singing it together now I bet you even tell her How you love her In between the chorus and the verse So when you gonna tell her that we did that too She thinks it's special but it's all reused That was our place, I found it first I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you Do you get deja vu when she's with you Do you get deja vu ...Do you get deja vu Strawberry ice cream in Malibu don't act like we didn't do that shit too You're trading jackets like we used to do (Yeah, everything is all reused) Play her piano but she doesn't know that I was the one who taught you Billy Joel A different girl now but there's nothing new (I know you get deja vu) ... ...I know you get deja vu ... ...I know you get deja vu"
