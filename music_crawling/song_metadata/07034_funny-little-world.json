  "lyrics": "- - - Suddenly I'm famous and people know my name I've got a thousand girls just waiting, and therefore it's a shame That my heart has been captured by your funny little smile And finally I'm happy, if only for a while People call me stupid for treating you like a Queen But I don't even worry, 'cause you're my unfor seen And I hope that you'll be with me, if only in my dreams But here you are next to me, and you're glad or so it seems And I don't know for sure where this is going Still I hope for more and more 'Cause who would know that you would treat me like a boy And I'd treat you like a girl in this funny little world   (x2) Don't promise me for ever, just love me day by day No one knows the future, we're young but that's okay 'Cause you'll always be a part of me whatever life will bring And people have to bear with you, this silly song I sing Your boyfriends might be angry, my girlfriends might be blue But no one can deny it, from now on I love you I have to say it's new to me; this feeling in my heart Guess I've been kind of lonely, and you've been kind of smart And I don't know for sure where this is going Still I hope for more and more 'Cause who would know that you would treat me like a boy And I'd treat you like a girl in this funny little world"
