I see your monsters I see your pain Tell me your problems I’ll chase them away I’ll be your lighthouse I’ll make it okay When I see your monsters I’ll stand there so brave And chase them all away I see your monsters I see your pain Tell me your problems I’ll chase them away I’ll be your lighthouse I’ll make it okay When I see your monsters I’ll stand there so brave And chase them all away"
