I swore I knew the melody That I heard you singin And when u smiled you made me feel Like I could sing along But then you went and changed the words Now my heart is empty Im only left with used to be’s and once upon a song Now I know your not a fairytale, and dreams were meant for sleepin And wishes upon a star just don’t come true Cause now even I can tell that I confused my feelings with the truth Cause I like the view when there was me and you I cant believe that I could be so right Its like you were floatin when I was fallin and I didn’t mind Cause I like the view Ohhh I thought you felt it too When there was me and you…"
