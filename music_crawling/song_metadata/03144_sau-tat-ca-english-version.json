  "lyrics": "When it ends, I will see you again To start over new, as if we had just met When it ends, I will stay the same And after the days we were apart I know that we can go back There were times we were stuffy You said no word to me, you just left Time has likely stopped, seems like everything's gone To let my heart realize I need you My love for you has always been retained It's got too great so I can't hold it back I just need you to show me your innocence All hardships are only a test Because our hearts belong in one place When it ends, we'll walk the same way A street where we can hold our hands to its end When it ends, we'll share everything There's no sorrow that would split us both And we just stay all so close There were times we were stuffy You said no word to me, you just left Time has likely stopped, seems like everything's gone To let my heart realize I need you My love for you has always been retained It's got too great so I can't hold it back I just need you to show me your innocence All hardships are only a test Because our hearts belong in one place Just take my hand and let us walk all our lifetimes All heavy steps we'll overcome And you will see that we've got so close My love for you has always been retained It's got too great so I can't hold it back I just need you to show me your innocence All hardships are only a test Because our hearts belong in one place"
