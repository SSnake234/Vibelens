Another’s hands have touched my skin I won’t tell him where I’ve been He knows, he knows, he knows It’s tearing me apart, She’s slipping away (I’m slipping away) Am I just hanging on to all the words she used to say? The pictures on her phone She’s not coming home (I’m not coming home) Coming home, coming home I know what you did last summer, (Ah-ah) Just lied to me, there’s no other (Hey-ey) I know what you did last summer, Tell me where you’ve been? I know what you did last summer, (Ah-ah) Look me in the eyes my lover (Hey-ey) I know what you did last summer, Tell me where you’ve been? I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know (Ah-ah) (Hey-ey) I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know (Ah-ah) (Hey-ey) I didn’t mean it, no, I didn’t mean it, mean it, no (Ah-ah) (Hey-ey) Can’t seem to let you go, can’t seem to hold you close (Ah-ah) (Hey-ey) I know When she looks me in the eyes They don’t seem as bright, No more, no more, I know That she loved me at one time Would I promise her that night Cross my heart and hope to die It’s tearing me apart She’s slipping away (I’m slipping away) Am I just hanging on to all the words she used to say? The pictures on her phone (Pictures on my phone) She’s not coming home (I’m not coming home) Oh, na na na yeah I know what you did last summer, (Ah-ah) Just lied to me, there’s no other (Hey-ey) I know what you did last summer, Tell me where you’ve been? I know what you did last summer, (Ah-ah) Look me in the eyes my lover (Hey-ey) I know what you did last summer, Tell me where you’ve been? I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know (No, no, no) Can’t seem to let you go, can’t seem to keep you close (Hold me close) Can’t seem to let you go, can’t seem to keep you close Tell me where you’ve been lately, tell me where you’ve been lately Tell me where you’ve been lately, tell me where you’ve been lately Can’t seem to keep you close, can’t seem to let you go I know you didn’t mean it though, I know you didn’t mean it though Tell me you didn’t mean it though, tell me you didn’t mean it though I know you didn’t mean it though, I wanna know you mean it though I know you didn’t mean it though, I know you didn’t mean it though Can’t seem to let you go, can’t seem to hold you close, I know what you did last summer, (Ah-ah) Just lied to me, there’s no other (Hey-ey) I know what you did last summer, Tell me where you’ve been?
