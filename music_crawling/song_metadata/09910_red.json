  "lyrics": " Lovin' him is like, drivin' a new Maser ati Down a dead end street Faster than the wind, passio nate as sin Ended so suddenly Loving him is like, tryin' to change your mind Once you're already flying through the free fall Like the colors in autumn so bright Just before they lose it all Losing him was blue, like I'd never known Missing him was dark grey, all alone Forgetting him was like trying to know some body You never met But loving him was red Re ee ed, re ee ed, re ee ed Lovin' him was red Re ee ed, re ee ed, re ee ed Touching him was like, realizing all you ever wanted Was right there in front of you Memorizing him was as, easy as knowin' all the words To your old favorite song Fighting with him was like tryin' to solve a Crossword and realizing there's no right answer Regretting him was like wishing you never found love But love could be that srong Losing him was blue, like I'd never known Missing him was dark grey, all alone Forgetting him was like trying to know some body You never met But loving him was red Re ee ed, re ee ed, re ee ed Lovin' him was red Re ee ed, re ee ed, re ee ed Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echos Tellin' myself it's time now gotta let go But moving on from him is impossible When I still see it all in my, head And burning red Burning was reeeeed"
