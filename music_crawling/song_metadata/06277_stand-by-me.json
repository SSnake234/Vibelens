So darlin', darlin' stand by me, oh now stand by me, stand by me, stand by me. If the sky that we look up- on should tumble and fall And the mount- ain should crumble to the sea I won't cry, I won't cry, no I won't shed a tear Just as long as you stand, stand by me me. So darling, darling stand by me, oh now stand by me, stand by me, stand by me.        stand by me, oh now stand by me, stand by me, stand by me. "
