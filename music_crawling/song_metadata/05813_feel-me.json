  "lyrics": "Capo 5.  Tone Đánh vòng  No one love you like I love you I never cheated, never lied I never put no one above you I gave you space and time And now you're telling me you miss me And I'm still on your mind We were one in a million Our love is hard to find Do you stay up late just so you don't dream ? Every time your lips touch another I want you to feel me, I want you to feel me Every time you dance with somebody I want you to feel me, I want you to feel me Do your days get a little bit longer? Nights get a little bit colder? Heartbeat a little bit louder? Days get a little bit longer? Nights get a little bit colder? Heartbeat a little bit louder? When you're running, who you run to? Where do you go to hide? When she ain't giving you enough to get you through the night Won't be caught up in the middle Through your highs and your lows Baby, 'long as you're not with me, you'll always be alone Do you stay up late just so you don't dream ? Every time your lips touch another I want you to feel me, I want you to feel me Every time you dance with somebody I want you to feel me, I want you to feel me Do your days get a little bit longer? Nights get a little bit colder? Heartbeat a little bit louder? Days get a little bit longer? Nights get a little bit colder? Heartbeat a little bit louder?"
