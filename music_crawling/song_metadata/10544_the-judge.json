I found my way Right time wrong place As I pled my case You're the judge, Oh no Set me free You're the judge, Oh no Set me free I know my soul's freezing Hell's hot for good reason So please I don't know if this song Is a surrender or a revel I don't know if this one Is about me or the devil I don't know if this song Is a surrender or a revel I don't know if this one Is about me or the devil You're the judge, Oh no Set me free You're the judge, Oh no Set me free I know my soul's freezing Hell's hot for good reason So please Na Na Na Na Oh Oh Na Na Na Na Oh Oh Na Na Na Na Oh Oh You're the judge, Oh no Set me free You're the judge, Oh no Set me free You're the judge, Oh no Set me free You're the judge, Oh no Set me free"
