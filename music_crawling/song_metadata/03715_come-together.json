H e wear no shoe shine, he got toe jam football H e got monkey finger, he shoot co-ca cola H e say, \"I know you, you know me.\" O ne thing I can tell you is you got to be free Co me Together, R ight now, over me H e bag production, He got wal-rus gumboot H e got O-no sideboard, He one spinal cracker He go t feet down below his knee Hol d you in his armchair, you can feel his disease Co me together, right now, over me H e roller coaster, he got early warning He got muddy water, He one Mo-jo filter He s ay, \" One and one and one is three.\" G ot to be good looking 'cause he so hard to see Com e together, Right now, over me"
