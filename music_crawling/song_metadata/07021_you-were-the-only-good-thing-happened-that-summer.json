Tone Are you in love with someone else young girl I couldn't let you gonna try to pre tend like I did Every time I try to see you but just Standing at your door It's like a dream of your in day season I guess I'll never know Where are we losing your connec tion September's sky won't shine no more And hey Don't count me out Just please don't tell me that I'll be fine Every kisses, every touches now means every everything na- now, do na- now, I give my clothes to run away with you na-now, do na-now, I said I will Remember all the things we used to work that summer Maybe some promises we've broken I say good night when you can't sleep Standing in the room with all the smell of you But now won't feel the same It's not enough for you   And I thought of giving up on you what do I do I still sing that same old song Pretty sure that you won't forget that Wednesday's night I just dying to kiss you Miss you Stuck in the moment forever I hope to find my way to make it better I hate this bed is changing how I sleep Like it always does, just wasn't meant to be And hey Don't count me out Just please don't tell me that I'll be fine Every kisses, every touches now means every everything na- now, till na- now, I hate your picture laying on my mind na- now, till na- now, I said I will Remember all the things we used to work that summer Maybe some promises we've broken I say good night when you can't sleep Standing in the room with all the smell of you But now won't feel the same It's not for me to say just once again like just before , I woke up this morning and look around Confront the emptiness left No matter how hard I try to standing still our ghost is haunting me again   na- now, do na- now, I give my clothes to run away with you na-now, do na-now, I said I will Remember all the things we used to work that summer Maybe some promises we've broken I say good night when you can't sleep Standing in the room with all the smell of you But now won't feel the same It's not enough for you  "
