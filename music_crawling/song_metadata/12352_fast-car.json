Tone Intro:  X4 You got a fast car I want a ticket to anywhere Maybe we make a deal Maybe together we can get somewhere Any place is better Starting from zero, got nothing to lose Maybe we'll make something Me myself, I got nothing to prove  X2 You got a fast car I got a plan to get us out of here I been working at the convenience store Managed to save just a little bit of money Won't have to drive too far Just 'cross the border and into the city You and I can both get jobs And finally see what it means to be living  X2 You see, my old man's got a problem He live with the bottle, that’s the way it is He says his body's too old for working His body's too young to look like his My mama went off and left him, she wanted more from life than he could give I said, \" Somebody's got to take care of him.\" So I quit school and that's what I did  X2 You got a fast car But is it fast enough so we can fly away? We gotta make a decision Leave tonight or live and die this way  X2 So I remember when: we were driving, driving in your car The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk City lights lay out before us And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder And I had a feeling that I belonged And I had a feeling I could -- be someone, be someone, be someone  X2 You got a fast car And we go cruising to entertain ourselves You still ain't got a job And I work in a market as a checkout girl I know things will get better You'll find work and I'll get promoted We'll move out of the shelter Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs  X2 So I remember when: we were driving, driving in your car The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk City lights lay out before us And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder And I had a feeling that I belonged And I had a feeling I could -- be someone, be someone, be someone  X2 You got a fast car And I got a job that pays all our bills You stay out drinking late at the bar You see more your friends than you do your kids I'd always hoped for better Thought maybe together you and me would find it I got no plans I ain't going nowhere So take your fast car and keep on driving  X2 So I remember when: we were driving, driving in your car The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk City lights lay out before us And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder And I had a feeling that I belonged And I had a feeling I could -- be someone, be someone, be someone You got a fast car But is it fast enough so we can fly away? We gotta make a decision Leave tonight or live and die this way  X3 "
