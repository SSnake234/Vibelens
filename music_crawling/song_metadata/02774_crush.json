  "lyrics": "I hung up the phone to night, some thing happened for the first time, deep inside It was a rush, what a rush Cause the possibility that you would ever Feel the same way about me It’s just too much.. just too much Why do I keep running from the truth All I ever think about is you You got me hypnotized, so mesmerized, and I just got to know Do you ever think, when you’re all alone All that we could be, Where this thing could go Am I crazy or falling in love Is it really just another crush Do you catch a breath, when I look at you Are you holding back, like the way I do Cause I’m trying, try to walk away   But I know this crush ain’t going away, going away Has it ever crossed your mind when we were hanging Spending time girl, are we just friends Is there more, is there more See it’s a chance we’ve gotta take Cause I believe we can make this into Something that will last, last forever, forever Do you ever think, when you’re all alone All that we could be, Where this thing could go Am I crazy or falling in love Is it really just another crush Do you catch a breath, when I look at you Are you holding back, like the way I do Cause I’m trying, tryin' to walk away But I know this crush ain’t going away, going away Why do I keep running from the truth All I ever think about is You got me hypnotized, so mesmerized And I just got to know Do you ever think, when you’re all alone All that we could be, Where this thing could go Am I crazy or falling in love Is it really just another crush Do you catch a breath, when I look at you Are you holding back, like the way I do Cause I’m trying, tryin' to walk away But I know this crush ain’t going away, going"
