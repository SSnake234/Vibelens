I'm right over here, why can't you see me, oh.. I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the girl your taking home, ooohh.. I keep dancing on my own I'm just gonna dance all night I'm all messed up, I'm so outta line Stilettos and broken bottles , I'm spinnin' around in circles I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh.. I'm right over here, why can't you see me, oh.. I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the girl your taking home, ooohh.. I keep dancing on my own  so far away but still so near (the lights go on, the music dies) but you don't see me standing here (I just came to say goodbye) I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh.. I'm right over here, why can't you see me, oh.. I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the girl your taking home, ooohh.. I keep dancing on my own I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh.. I'm right over here, why can't you see me, oh.. I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the girl your taking home, ooohh.. I keep dancing on my own"
