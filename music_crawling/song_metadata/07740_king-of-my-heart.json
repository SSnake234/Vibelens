  "lyrics": "I'm perfectly fine I lived on my own I made up my mind i'm better off being alone We met a few weeks ago Now you try on calling me baby like tryin' on clothes. Salute to me, I'm your American Queen And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat And we rule the kingdom inside my room. Cause all the boys with their expensive cars with Their Range Rover and their Jaguars Never took me quite where you do. And all at once you are the one I have been waiting for King of my heart , body and soul. And all at once you're all I want I'll never let you go King of my heart , body and soul. And all at once, I have been waiting, waiting... oohwah oohwah And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting, waiting.... body and soul And all at once. Late in the night The city's asleep Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep Change my priorities The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury. Is this the end of all the endings? My broken bones are mending With all this nights we're spending Drinking beer out of plastic cups Say you fancy me not fancy stuff Baby all at once this is enough."
