  "lyrics": "  All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go. I'm standing here out-side your door I hate to wake you up to say good-bye. But the dawn is breaking, it's early morn, The taxi's waiting, he's blowing his horn Al-ready I'm so lonesome I could die. So kiss me and smile for me Tell me that you'll wait for me Hold me like you'll never let me go. I'm leaving on a jet plane Don't know when I'll be back again Oh babe I hate to go there's so many times I've let you down So many times I've played around I tell you now they don't mean a thing every place i go i'll think of you every song i sing i'll sing for you when i come back i'll bring your wedding ring. So kiss me and smile for me Tell me that you'll wait for me Hold me like you'll never let me go. I'm leaving on a jet plane Don't know when I'll be back again Oh babe I hate to go Now the time has come to leave you One more time let me kiss you Then close your eyes I'll be on my way Dream about the days to come When I won't have to leave alone A-bout the times I won't have to say. So kiss me and smile for me Tell me that you'll wait for me Hold me like you'll never let me go. I'm leaving on a jet plane Don't know when I'll be back again Oh babe I hate to go"
