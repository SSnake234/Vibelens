In your head, in your head, zombie, zombie, zombie What's in your head, in your head, zombie, zombie, zombie Anothers mother's breaking, heart is taking over. When the violence caused silence, we must be mistaken. It's the same old theme since 1916, in your head, in your head, they're still fighting With their tanks and their bombs en' their guns, In your head, in your head, they're dying. In your head, in your head, zombie, zombie, zombie What's in your head, in your head, zombie, zombie, zombie Outro "
