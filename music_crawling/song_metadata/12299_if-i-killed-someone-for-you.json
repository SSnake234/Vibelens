  "lyrics": "Sorry that I did this, the blood is on my hands I stare at my reflection, I don't know who I am Practice my confession. In case I take the stand I'll say I learned my lesson, I'll be a better man I'm packing up my things and I'm wiping down the walls I'm rinsing off my clothes and I'm walking through the halls I did it all for her so I felt nothing at all I don't know what she'll say, so I'll ask her when she calls Would you love me more? (would you love me more?) If I killed someone for you They're the same that I used When I killed someone for you Would you turn me in? (would you turn me in?) When I say I'm on the loose My face is on the news? 'Cuz I killed someone for you I hear the sirens coming, I see the flashing lights I'm driving through the suburbs, wearing my disguise I show up at her doorstep to look her in the eyes I tell her that it's me, but she doesn't recognize Can't you see I'm running? Said I need a place to hide I've gotta ask you something, could you please let me inside? Just let me explain, no I wouldn't tell you lies I know you'll understand if you let me stay the night Would you love me more? (would you love me more?) If I killed someone for you They're the same that I used When I killed someone for you Would you turn me in? (would you turn me in?) When I say I'm on the loose My face is on the news? 'Cuz I killed someone for you You have to understand that the one I killed is me Changing what I was for what you wanted me to be I followed your direction, did everything you asked I hope it makes you happy, 'cuz there's just no turning back Would you love me more? (would you love me more?) If I killed someone for you They're the same that I used When I killed someone for you Would you turn me in? (would you turn me in?) When I say I'm on the loose My face is on the news? 'Cuz I killed someone for you"
