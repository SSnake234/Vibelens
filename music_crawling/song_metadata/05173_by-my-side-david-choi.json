  "lyrics": "I'm just listening to the clock Go ticking, I am waiting As the time goes by... I think of you With every breath I take I need to feel mine. You're all I see... In everything... I just wanna hold you, I just wanna kiss you, I just wanna love you all my life. I normally wouldn't say this, but I just cant contain it. I want you here forever Right here by my side. All the fears you feared inside, And all the tears youve cried; They're ending right here. I'll heal your heart and, So I'll keep you all so close. Dont worry, I'll never let you go. You're all I need.. You're everything... I just wanna hold you, I just wanna kiss you, I just wanna love you all my life. I normally wouldn't say this, but I just cant contain it. I want you here forever Right here by my side. No one else would ever do, I gotta stubborn heart for you Call me crazy but it's true, I didnt think that it would be, You made it clear for me; You're all I need. I just wanna hold you, I just wanna kiss you, I just wanna love you all my life. I normally wouldn't say this, but I just cant contain it. I want you here forever Right here by my side."
