  "lyrics": "  You and I were like fireworks and symphonies exploding in the sky. With you i'm alive like all the missing pieces of my heart, they finally collide So stop time right here in the moonlight cause i don't ever wanna close my eyes Without you, i feel broke like i'm half of a whole Without you, i've got no hand to hold Without you, i feel torn, like a sail in a storm Without you i'm just a sad song  With you i fall its like im leaving all my past and silhouettes upon the wall With you im a beautiful mess its like were standing hand in hand with all our fears upon the edge So stop time right here in the moonlight cause i don't ever wanna close my eyes Without you, i feel broke like i'm half of a whole Without you, i've got no hand to hold Without you, i feel torn, like a sail in a storm Without you i'm just a sad song  You're the perfect melody, the only harmony i wanna hear  You're my favorite part of me, the girl standing next to me ive got nothing to fear Without you, i feel broke like i'm half of a whole Without you, i've got no hand to hold Without you, i feel torn, like a sail in a storm Without you i'm just a sad song Without you, i feel broke like i'm half of a whole Without you, i've got no hand to hold Without you, i feel torn, like a sail in a storm Without you i'm just a sad song  "
