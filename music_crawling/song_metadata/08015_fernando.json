I remember long ago another starry night like this In the firelight Fer nando You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your g uitar of bugle calls were coming from af ar They were closer now Fernando Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternal ly I was so afraid Fer nando We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to d ie Almost made me cr y There was something in the a ir that night The stars were bright, Fer nando They were shining there for you and me, for liberty, Ferna ndo Though we never thought that we could lo se, there's no regret If I had to do the same again, I would, my friend, Fernan do If I had to do the same again, I would, my friend, Fernan do Now we're old and grey Fer nando And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand Can you hear the drums Fer nando? Do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Gr ande? For freedom in this land"
