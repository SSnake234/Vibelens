Oh somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue And the dreams that you dare to dream, really do come true...... Someday i'll wish Oh...upon a star Wake up where the clouds are far behind me Where trouble melts like lemon drops High above the chimney tops that's where you'll find me Oh somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly Birds fly over the rainbow, why then oh why can't I....... I.......?"
