  "lyrics": "I am thinking of you In my sleepless solitude tonight If it's wrong to love you Then my heart won't let me right Cause I'm drowning in you And I won't pull through Without you by my side I'd give my all to have Just one more night with you I'd risk my life to have Your body next to mine Cause I can't go on Living in the memory of your song I'd give my all for your love tonight I'd give my all for your love  tonight."
