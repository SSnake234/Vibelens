I’m holdidn’ on, Myself was never enough for me Gotta be so strong There’s a power in what you do, Now, every other day I’ll be watching you Oh- oh, Oh- oh, Show you what it feels like, now I’m on the outside Oh- oh, We did everything right, now I’m on the outside Oh- oh, Show you what it feels like, now I’m on the outside Oh- oh, We did everything right, now I’m on the outside  (x2) Though you give me no reason For me to stay close to you, Tell me what lovers do How are we still breathing? It’s never for us to choose, I’ll be the strength in you. I’m holdidn’ on, Myself was never enough for me Gotta be so strong There’s a power in what you do, Now, every other day I’ll be watching you Oh- oh, Oh- oh, Show you what it feels like, now I’m on the outside Oh- oh, We did everything right, now I’m on the outside Oh- oh, Show you what it feels like, now I’m on the outside Oh- oh, We did everything right, now I’m on the outside  (x2) I’ll show you what it feels like, now I’m on the outside (eeeey ) I’ll show you what it feels like... I’ll show you what it feels like, now I’m on the outside We did everything right, now I’m on the outside  (x4)"
