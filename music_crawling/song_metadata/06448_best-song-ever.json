Said her name was Georgia Rose And her daddy was a dentist Said I had a dirty mouth (I got a dirty mouth) But she kissed me like she meant it I said, \" Can you give it back to me?\" She said, \" Never in your wildest dreams.\" And we danced all night to the best song ever We knew every line now I can't remember How it goes but I know that I won't forget her Cuz we danced all night to the best song ever I think it went oh, oh, oh I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah I think it goes... You know, I know, you know I'll remember you And I know, you know, I know you'll remember me And you know, I know, you know I'll remember you And I know, you know, I hope you'll remember how we danced (Yeah, yeah, yeah) how we danced And we danced all night to the best song ever We knew every line now I can't remember How it goes but I know that I won't forget her Cuz we danced all night to the best song ever And we danced all night to the best song ever We knew every line now I can't remember How it goes but I know that I won't forget her Cuz we danced all night to the best song ever I think it went oh, oh, oh I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah I think it goes... Best song ever It was the best song ever It was the best song ever It was the best song ever "
