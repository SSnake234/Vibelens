  "lyrics": "All I knew this morning when I woke Is I know something now, know something now I didn't before And all I've seen since 18 hours ago The back of my mind making me feel like I just want to know you better know, you better know you, better now I just want to know you better know, you better know, you better now I just want to know you better know, you better know, you better now I just want to know you, know you, know you Cause all I know is we said hello And your eyes look like coming home All I know is a simple name, everything has changed All I know is you held the door You'll be mine and I'll be yours All I know since yesterday, is everything has changed Ve Ve rse 2  And all my walls stood tall, painted blue But I'll take them down, take them down And open up the door for you And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies Taking flight, making me feel like I just want to know you better know, you better know you, better now I just want to know you better know, you better know, you better now I just want to know you better know, you better know, you better now I just want to know you, know you, know you Cause all I know is we said hello And your eyes look like coming home All I know is a simple name, everything has changed All I know is you held the door You'll be mine and I'll be yours All I know since yesterday, is everything has changed Come back and tell me why I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time Ahhh And meet me there tonight And let me know that it's not all in my mind I just want to know you better know, you better know, you better now I just want to know you, know you, know you Cause all I know is we said hello And your eyes look like coming home All I know is a simple name, everything has changed All I know is you held the door You'll be mine and I'll be yours All I know since yesterday, is everything has changed All I know is we said hello So dust off your highest hopes All I know is pouring rain All I know is a new found grace All my days, I'll know your face All I know since yesterday, is everything has changed"
