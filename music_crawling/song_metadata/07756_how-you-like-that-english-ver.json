You gon' like that that that that that How you like that? How you like that that that that that? Now look at you now look at me. Look at you now look at me Look at you now look at me. How you like that? Now look at you now look at me. Look at you now look at me Look at you now look at me. How you like that? Your girl need it all and that’s a hundred 10 out of 10, what I want I got it Karma a come and get some What’s up I’m right back Plane Jane get hijacked I say come come, I’m done done I’ll shine like the stars While looking in your eyes I’ll kiss you goodbye So go ahead, laugh and smile, while you still can I am coming for you now Ha how you like that? You gon' like that that that that that How you like that? How you like that that that that that? Now look at you now look at me. Look at you now look at me Look at you now look at me. How you like that? Now look at you now look at me. Look at you now look at me Look at you now look at me. How you like that? That day when I fell without my wings I cried Spent a lifetime in the darkness, there I lied Should’ve ended me when you had the chance Look up in sky its a bird its a plane"
