  "lyrics": "Intro: - - (x2) You, Do you remember me Like I remember you Do you spend you life going back in your mind to that time Cause I, I walk the streets alone I hate being on my own And everyone can see that, I really fell And I'm going through hell Thinking about you with somebody else Somebody wants you Somebody needs you Somebody dreams about you every single night Somebody can't breathe Without you it's lonely And somebody hopes that one day you'll see That somebody's me That somebody's me And somebody hopes that someday you'll see That somebody's me You will alway be in my life Even if I'm not in your life Cause you're in my memory"
