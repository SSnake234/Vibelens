  "lyrics": "You ain’t even really gotta lie I just need you to say good bye Then I really let you go So just stop wasting my time I’ll never come around you again no more This will be the end now just shut the door But you’ll miss me everyday It will probably make you wanna go and drive yourself insane You could’ve had it all but you broke my heart And now I gotta do what I do You know you always bring out the best in me But you played me for a fool Why you do that babe It doesn’t have to be this way But there’s no way I could stay …… And your eyes, nose, lips it haunts my memory I can’t forget you if I tried I wanna believe in your lies And your eyes, nose, lips it haunts my memory I can’t forget you if I died Feels like I’m losing my mind Tired and tired I’m so done Before you wake up I will be gone No more sitting home alone You don’t deserve my love Now you can go look for that girl next door Cause you ain’t the one I can call my own I know you’ll miss me everyday It will probably make you wanna go and drive yourself insane You could’ve had it all but you broke my heart And now I gotta do what I do You know you always bring out the best in me But you played me for a fool Why you do that babe It doesn’t have to be this way But there’s no way I could stay …… And your eyes, nose, lips it haunts my memory I can’t forget you if I tried I wanna believe in your lies And your eyes, nose, lips it haunts my memory I can’t forget you if I died Feels like I’m losing my mind I wish that I can make it all just go away But it seems like there’s no where I can escape Thought that I’d be okay If I never have to see your face again And your eyes, nose, lips it haunts my memory I can’t forget you if I tried I wanna believe in your lies And your eyes, nose, lips it haunts my memory I can’t forget you if I died Feels like I’m losing my mind"
