You could run with me Place your hand in mine, you gotta stay, hold up Want to leave it be hind, dark cruel days, in deep, you may have hid be fore I’m em bracing you un til more heat dis solve what is caught up Sun will soon rise up into a day you’re no more too afraid Keep all of me in you       Only percei ving through your eyes I see no thing, I’ll soon hate you, keep me out, I’m cry ing out You’re falling into deeper fasci nation, gi ving away your love That ex pression has got me crying out She’s gonna try to me, she’s gonna lie Got to force a be lief and trust to keep on Every time it happens, heap of at tack, and now I’m back in I got to cry, then who knows? So we gotta keep on If you gotta keep on Then we’re gonna keep on One day, we will under stand, I’m be lieving in you       “No, wanna stop it, you got me tired of walking” As I show my needs, I reach to get back on, still not fit in You free my hand, then leave it “No, wanna stop it, you got me tired of walking” Never told you the truth, I’m feeling that inside Back for another “tick and tocking” mode Never refraining shamble, block of sound Killing, oh, too many words that I gathered around Won’t let me go to your mind “I want it to be done” is what went out It found a way to final ly leak out of me And for once, I could make you let out a smile Saw what got seen hid be neath, and louder nights are keeping me down My new images of you, now, appear heavenly now What can “night” for you mean when fallen seas of tears are gone They dis solve into the peace inside of you ahh..ahh! Calling to life, hit be neath, crying days in the eter nal Give me what I saw in you, oh, what an end to stop all Seize a move, you’re on me, falling and we were dissol ving See me to it, fog is leaving, bright air move Want to leave it be hind, tucked all days away, for get, and hid be neath Hand in hand, extend to me, that let me know beyond falls Through the seas of be yond, so loud and blows you afloat in the sky New wind mo ving into you Tonight, don’t e ver lose sight of me and let go You and me are running through the night in dark, (dừng)I’ll take you      "
