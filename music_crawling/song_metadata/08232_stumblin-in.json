Wherever you go, whatever you do, you know, these reckless thoughts of mine are following you. I've fallen for you, whatever you do, 'cause baby, you've shown me so many things, that I never knew. Whatever it takes, baby, I'll do it for you.    You were so young, ah, and I was so free, I may have been young, but baby, that's not what I wanted to be. Well, you were the one, oh, why was it me, 'cos baby, you showed me so many things that I'd never see. Whatever you need, baby, you've got it from me. Our love is alive, and so we begin, foolishly laying our hearts on the table, stumblin' in. Our love is a flame , burning with in, now and then firelight will catch us, stumblin' in. Stumblin' in, stumblin' in, foolishly laying our hearts on the table, stumblin' in..... Ah, stumblin' in, stumblin' in ..."
