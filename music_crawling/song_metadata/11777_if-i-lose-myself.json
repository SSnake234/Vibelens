You can see your life out of the window, tonight... If I lose myself tonight It'll be by your side If I lose myself tonight... If I lose myself tonight It'll be you and I... Lose myself tonight    I woke up with the sun Thought of all the people, places and things I've loved I woke up just to see Of all the faces you are the one next to me You can feel the light start to tremble watching what you know out to see… You can see your life out of the window, tonight... If I lose myself tonight It'll be by your side If I lose myself tonight... If I lose myself tonight It'll be you and I... Lose myself tonight whooooooo...    Take us down and we keep trying 40 000 feet keep flying... Take us down and we keep trying 40 000 feet keep flying... Take us down and we keep trying 40 000 feet keep flying... Take us down and we keep trying 40 000 feet keep flying... Take us down and we keep trying 40 000 feet keep flying... Lose  myself If I lose myself tonight..  Whoooooooooo  whoooooo"
