You’re the light, you’re the night You’re the cure, you’re the pain You’re the only thing I wanna touch Never knew that it could mean so much You’re the color of my blood ‘Cause I’ve never been so high Let me take you past our satellites You can see the world you brought to life You’re the fear, I don’t care Follow me through the dark I’m hurting, baby, I’m broken down I need your loving, loving BG: oh When I’m without you <> I’m something weak You got me begging, begging I’m on my knees. I’ll let you set the pace How can we not talk about family when family’s all that we got? Everything I went throught you were standing there by my side And now you gonna be with me for the last ride It's been a long day without you, my friend And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again We've come a long way from where we began Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again Yeah… - - - So let the light guide your way, yeah Hold every memory as you go And every road you take, will always lead you home, home, Love me like you do, love me like you do Love me like you do, love me like you do It’s been a long day Touch me like you do, touch me like you do Without you my friend Yeah, you show me good loving Make it alright And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again What do you waiting for When I see you again When I see you again"
