Did I waste your time? I tried to be there for you Then you tried to break mine It isn't asking for a lot for an a pology For making me feel like it'd kill you if I tried to leave You said you'd never fall in love again be cause of me Then you moved on im mediately (bum, bum, bum) But I wish you the best for the rest of your life Felt sorry for you when I looked in your eyes But I need to con fess, I told you a lie I said you You were the love of my life ...The love of my life So you found her, now go fall in love (go fall in love) Just like we were if I ever was (if I ever was) It's not my fault, I did what I could (did what I could) You made it so hard like I knew you would Thought I was de pressed or losing my mind My stomach up set almost all of the time But after I left, it was obvious why (oh), mm Because for you, ... you I was the love of your life, mm But you were not mine (but you were not mine)"
