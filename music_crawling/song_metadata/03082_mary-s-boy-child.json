  "lyrics": "Long time ago in Bethle hem, so the holy Bible say, Mary's boy child Jesus Christ was born on Christmas day. Hark, now hear the angels sing, the new king born today. And we shall live for ever more because of Christmas day! While shepards watched their flocks by night, They saw a bright new shining star. And then they heard a choir sing, the music seemed to come from afar Hark, now hear the angels sing, the new king born today. And we shall live for ever more because of Christmas day! Then by and by in Bethle hem, In a stable all forlorn. In a manger cold and dark, Mary's little boy child was born. Hark, now hear the angels sing, the new king born today. And we shall live for ever more because of Christmas day! And we shall live for ever more because of Christmas day!"
