  "lyrics": "If I die young Bury me in satin Lay me down on a bed of roses Sink me in the river at dawn Send me away with the words of a love song ...Oh oh, oh oh Lord make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother She'll know I'm safe with You when she stands under my colors Oh and life ain't always what you think it ought to be No, ain't even grey, but she buries her baby The sharp knife of a short life Well, I've had just enough time If I die young Bury me in satin Lay me down on a bed of roses Sink me in the river at dawn Send me away with the words of a love song The sharp knife of a short life Well, I've had just enough time And I'll be wearing white when I come into Your kingdom I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger I've never known the loving of a man but it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand There's a boy here in town says he'll love me forever Who would have thought forever could be severed by The sharp knife of a short life Well, I've had just enough time  x2 So put on your best boys And I'll wear my pearls What I never did is done A penny for my thoughts Oh no, I'll sell them for a dollar They're worth so much more after I'm a goner And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singing Funny when you're dead how people start listening  If I die young Bury me in satin Lay me down on a bed of roses Sink me in the river at dawn Send me away with the words of a love song ..Oh oh, the ballad of a dove ...Go in peace and love Gather up your tears Keep them in your pocket Save them for a time when you're really gonna need them Oh oh, the sharp knife of a short life Well, ..I've had just enough time So put on your best boys And I'll wear my pearls"
