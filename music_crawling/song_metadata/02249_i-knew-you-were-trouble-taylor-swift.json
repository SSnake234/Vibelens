Ahh oh oh, trouble, trouble, trouble Ahh oh oh, trouble, trouble, trouble No apologies, he'll never see you cry Pretends he doesn't know, that he's the reason why You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning-e-e-e-ing And I heard you moved on, from whispers on the street A new notch in your belt, is all I'll ever be And now I see, now I see, now I see-e-e-e-e He was long gone, when he met me And I realize, the joke is on me, yeah I knew you were trouble when you walked in So shame on me now-ow Flew me to places I'd never been 'Till you put me down, oh I knew you were trouble when you walked in So shame on me now-ow Flew me to places I'd never been Now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground! Ahh oh oh, trouble, trouble, trouble Ahh oh oh, trouble, trouble, trouble And the sadest fear, comes creepin' in That you never loved me or her, Or anyone, or anything, yeah yeah I knew you were trouble when you walked in So shame on me now-ow Flew me to places I'd never been (never been) 'Till you put me down, oh I knew you were trouble when you walked in (you were right there) So shame on me now-ow Flew me to places I'd never been Now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground! Ahh oh oh, trouble, trouble, trouble Ahh oh oh, trouble, trouble, trouble I knew you were trouble when you walked in Trouble, trouble, trouble I knew you were trouble when you walked in trouble, trouble, trouble"
