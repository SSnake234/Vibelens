But you never wanna be each others' I say, \" Don't look back\" But I go right back and All a sudden, I'm hypnotized You're the one that I can't deny Every time that I say I'm gonna walk away You turn me on like a light switch When you're movin' your body around and around Now, I don't wanna fight this (No) You know how to just make me want You turn me on like a light switch When you're movin' your body around and around You got me in a tight grip (Yeah) You know how to just make me want you, baby ...Do you love it when you keep me guessin' (Me guessin') When you're leaving then you leave me stressin'? (Me stressin') But I can't stay mad when you walk like that, no ...Why you always wanna act like lovers? But you never wanna be each others' I said, \" Don't look back\" But I go right back and All a sudden, I'm hypnotized You're the one that I can't deny Every time that I say I'm gonna walk away You turn me on like a light switch When you're movin' your body around and around Now, I don't wanna fight this (No) You know how to just make me want You turn me on like a light switch When you're movin' your body around and around You got me in a tight grip (Yeah) You know how to just make me want you, baby Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on and show me how you do (You do) You want, you want, you want, you want, you wanna keep me wantin' you (Me wantin' you, girl) Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on and (Hey), show me how you do (How you do) You want, you want, you want, you want, you wanna keep me wantin' you You turn me on like a light switch When you're movin' your body around and around Now, I don't wanna fight this (No) You know how to just make me want to You turn me on like a light switch When you're movin' your body around and around You got me in a tight grip (Yeah) You know how to just make me want you, baby Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on and show me how you do (You do) You want, you want, you want, you want, you wanna keep me wantin' you (Me wantin' you, girl) Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on and (Hey), show me how you do (How you do) You want, you want, you want, you want, you wanna keep me wantin' you"
