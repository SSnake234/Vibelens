So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair I sat on a rug, biding my time, drin king her wine We talked until two, and then she said it's time for bed She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath And when I awoke, I was a lone this bird had flown So, I lit a fire, isn't it good Nor weg ian wood"
