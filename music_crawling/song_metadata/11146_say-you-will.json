Into deep, going in too deep I can't get you out of my mind Baby no matter just how hard I try I don't want to be alone tonight Chorus: Won't you be my guilding light Lead the way to be by your side Won't you be my star tonight I need more than a neon light 3. Say you will, say you will be mine I just keep missing you to- night I feel so unsure, I feel so alone I just don't dare to open my eyes   "
