What about your Your ten thousand promises That you gave to me Your ten thou sand promises That you promi ....sed me Once I could handle the truth when the truth was... you and I... Time after time all the promises turned out to be a lie... Now I see I'm just some body who wasted my time and money... What a life... you and I... What about your Your ten thousand promises That you gave to me Your ten thousand promises That you promised me You said I'll take you back But I closed the door 'Cause I don't want ten thousand more   Ten thousand promises yeah... ten thousand promises That you gave to me... What about your Your ten thou sand promises That you gave to me Your ten thousand promises That you prom ised me Your ten thou sand pro mises that you gave to me Your ten thou sand p romises that you gave to me Once we were lovers just lovers we were... Oh... you and I... What a life..."
