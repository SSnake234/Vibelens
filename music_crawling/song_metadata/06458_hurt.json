  "lyrics": "   Seems like it was yesterday when I saw your face You told me how proud you were but I walked away If only I knew what I know today Ohhhh... I would hold you in my arms I would take the pain away Thank you for all you've done Forgive all your mistakes There's nothing I wouldn't do To hear your voice again Sometimes I want to call you But I know you won't be there Ohhhhhhh..... I'm sorry for blaming you For every thing I just couldn't do And I've hurt myself by hurting you Some days I feel broke inside But I won't admit Sometimes I just want to hide 'Cause it's you I miss You know it's so hard to say goodbye When it comes to this Would you tell me I was wrong? Would you help me understand? Are you looking down upon me? Are you proud of who I am? There's nothing I wouldn't do To have just one more chance To look into your eyes And see you looking back Ohhhhhhhh... I'm sorry for blaming you For every thing I just couldn't do And I've hurt myself If I had just one more day I would tell you how much that I've missed you since you've been away Oh........ Oh, it's dangerous It's so out of line To try to turn back time I'm sorry for blaming you For every thing I just couldn't do And I've hurt myself  By hurting you"
