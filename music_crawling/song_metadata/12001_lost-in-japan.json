I'm a couple hundred miles from Ja pan, and I I was thinking I could fly to your ho tel tonight 'Cause I can't get you off my mind Can't get you off my mind, can't get you off my mind (oh) I could feel the tension We could cut it with a knife I know it's more than just a friendship I can hear you thinking 'bout it, yeah Do I gotta convince you? That you shouldn't fall asleep? It'll only be a couple hours And I'm a bout to leave Do you got plans tonight? I'm a couple hundred miles from Ja pan, and I I was thinking I could fly to your ho tel tonight 'Cause I can't get you off my mind Can't get you off my mind, can't get you off my mind Do you got plans tonight? I was hoping I could get lost in your paradise The only thing I'm thinking 'bout is you and I 'Cause I can't get you off my mind Can't get you off my mind, I can't seem to get you off my mind Let's get lost to night Let's get lost to night Baby, you and I can't seem to get you off my mind Let's get lost to night Let's get lost to night Baby, you and I can't seem to get you off my mind Ah- ahh, ah- ahh Ah- ahh  Do you got plans tonight? I'm a couple hundred miles from Ja pan, and I I was thinking I could fly to your ho tel tonight 'Cause I can't get you off my mind I can't get you off my mind Do you got plans tonight, baby? I was hoping I could get lost in your paradise (paradise) The only thing I'm thinking 'bout is you and I And I can't get you off my mind Can't get you off my mind, I can't seem to get you off my mind, yeah Let's get lost to night Let's get lost to night Baby, you and I can't seem to get you off my mind Let's get lost to night Let's get lost to night Baby, you and I can't seem to get you off my mind"
