I'm sorry it's all that i can say and i'd fix all that i've done if i could start again i'd throw it all away to the shadows of regrets and you would have the best of me   ........................ i know that i can't take back all of the mistakes but i will try although it's not easy i know you believe me cause i would not lie don't believe their lies told through jealous eyes they don't understand (i'm sorry) i won't break your heart i won't bring you down but i will have to say... I'm sorry it's all that i can say and i'd fix all that i've done if i could start again i'd throw it all away to the shadows of regrets and you would have the best of me  ..................  ..............  ............... I'm sorry it's all that i can say and i'd fix all that i've done if i could start again i'd throw it all away to the shadows of regrets and you would have the best of me"
