Folling me again… . No need to explain Taking my own lane GOD's helping me out Get over my doubt Thought I can't live without Forget you right now ah ah ah ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah Making my way, making my way I wanna know the cure For all that time you make me endure All the words you say Ought to keep your prey well and behaved I reckon it's time Betting my luck on dimes Taking new leap in Getting far away from your cheating Seeking for my em brace Wanting my touch, begging me to stay Every night and day Calling my name, shout it till you break You took my heart, Held it and ripped it apart Make me your priso ner, Got me going right under Feeling that you feign? Folling me again… . No need to explain Taking my own lane GOD's helping me out Get over my doubt Thought I can't live without Forget you right now ah ah ah ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah Making my way, making my way Feeling that you feign? Folling me again… . No need to explain Taking my own lane GOD's helping me out Get over my doubt Thought I can't live without Forget you right now ah ah ah ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah Telling me I'll kill for you With no proof Was a doll, now the thing you pulled Ner ver make me yield Pin you down like a golden view Make you dwell Wish you well Living right in the kingdom I build anew Draining tears and wallow in guilt"
