  "lyrics": "Oh you heard What they say Oh, the more things change The more they stay the same Ain't that a shame? (I know it's a shame) I've been good For some time I'd be lying if I said that You ain't on my mind Been tryin' to give it some time Feeling like I'm run nin' away Never had the chance, chance to say I can say that loving you is easy I don't need to prove a single thing Somewhere along the way I guess you got under my skin I put all my cards out on the table You ain't ever gonna show your hand I would rather hold you close than try to under stand    Mornin' sun, mornin' high Oh, I think this haze is for now my best dis guise No need to think about why What'cha say, starry- eyed How you love to smile And watch the clouds re side Just tryin' to give it some time Feeling like I'm run nin' a way Never had the chance, chance to say I can say that loving you is easy I don't need to prove a single thing Somewhere along the way I guess you got under my skin I put all my cards out on the table You ain't ever gonna show your hand I would rather hold you close than try to under stand"
