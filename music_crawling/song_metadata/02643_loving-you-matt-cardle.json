  "lyrics": "Intro: I wanna come over The night is only young I wanna get under your body Take you over, come undone But why do we only give it up? Give it up in the dark It's not enough, It's not enough for this heart Who do you think about when I'm not with you? Does somebody hold you when you let me go? You can't hide, you can't lie Cause baby I'm loving, loving, loving you I could tell myself that I don't need you I could try to run away from the truth I can't hide, I can't lie Cause baby I'm loving, loving, loving you My door is open Come on over, the night is still young I wanna get over your body Take you under, come undone But why do we only give it up? Give it up in the dark It's not enough, It's not enough for this heart Who do you think about when I'm not with you? Does somebody hold you when you let me go? You can't hide, you can't lie Cause baby I'm loving, loving, loving you I could tell myself that I don't need you I could try to run away from the truth I can't hide, I can't lie Cause baby I'm loving, loving, loving you Would it change if I asked you to stay? If I pulled, would it push you away? But it's just the chance I'll take Cause I want your loving Who do you think about when I'm not with you? Does somebody hold you when you let me go? You can't hide, you can't lie Cause baby I'm loving, loving, loving you I could tell myself that I don't need you I could try to run away from the truth I can't hide, I can't lie Cause baby I'm loving, loving, loving you"
