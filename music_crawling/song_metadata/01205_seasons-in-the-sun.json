  "lyrics": "Good bye to you my thrusted friend, We`ve known each other since we were nine or ten  Together we climbed hills and trees,  Learned of love A B C ; skinned our harts and skinned our knees. Good bye my friend it`s hard to die, when all the birds are singing in the sky Now that the spring is in the air Pretty girls are ev'ry where, think of me and I`ll be there We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun, But the hills that we climb were just seasons o0ut of time. Goodbye Papa, please pray for me I was the Black Sheep of the Family You tried to teach me right from wrong Too much wine and too much song Wonder how I got along Goodbye Papa, it's hard to die When all the bird's are singing in the sky Now that the spring is in the air Little Children every where When you see them I'll be there (Chorus in ) (Chorus in ) Goodbye Michelle, my little one You gave me Love and helped me find the sun And every time when I was down You would always come around And get my feet back on the ground Goodbye Michelle, it's hard to die When all the birds are singing in the sky Now that the spring is in the air With the flowers every where I wish that we could both be there (Chorus in ) (Chorus in ) All our lives we had fun, we had Seasons in the sun but the stars we could reach were just starfish on the beach"
