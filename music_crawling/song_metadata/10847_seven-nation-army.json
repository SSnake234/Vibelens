  "lyrics": "I'm gonna fight 'em off  A  seven nation army couldn't hold me back They're gonna rip it off   Taking their time right behind my back And I'm talking to myself at night Because I can't forget  Back and forth through my mind Behind a cigar ette  And a message coming from my eyes says leave it alone  x4  Don't want to hear about it  Every single one's got a story to tell Everyone knows about it  From the Queen of England to the hounds of Hell And if I catch it coming back my way I'm gonna serve it to you  And that ain't what you want to hear But that's what I'll do  And a feeling coming from my bones says find a home I'm going to Wichita  Far from this opera, forever more I'm going to work the straw  Make the sweat drip out of every pore And I'm bleeding and I'm ble eding and I'm bleeding Right before the Lord  All the words are going to bleed from me And I will think no more  And t he stains coming from my blood tell me go back home"
