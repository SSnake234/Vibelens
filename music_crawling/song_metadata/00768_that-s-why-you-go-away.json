(yes I know) You're never satisfied No matter how I tried Now you wanna say good bye to me Love is one big illusion I should try to for get But there is something left in my head Sitting here a lone in the middle of nowhere Don't know which way to go There ain't so much to say now bet ween us There ain't so much for you There ain't so much to me any more .. ....... ...... ... ......... ..............."
