  "lyrics": "tone  Some people live for the fortune Some people live just for the fame Some people live for the power yeah Some people live to play the game Some people think that the physical things Define what is within I've been there before But that life's a bore So full of the superfi cial Some people want it all But I don't want nothing at all If it ain't you baby If I ain't got you baby Some people want diamond rings Some just want e verything But everything means nothing If I ain't got you Some people search for a fountain The promises forever young Some people need three dozen roses And that's the only way to prove you love them Hand me a world on a silver platter And what good would it be? With no one to share, with no one who truly cares for me Some people want it all But I don't want nothing at all If it ain't you baby If I ain't got you baby Some people want diamond rings Some just want e verything But everything means nothing If I ain't got you"
