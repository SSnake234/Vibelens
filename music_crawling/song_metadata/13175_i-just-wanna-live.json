  "lyrics": "VE VE RS RS E 1:   I need an alarm system in my house So I know when people are creeping about These people are freakin' me out It's getting hectic everywhere that I go They won't just leave me alone There's things they all wanna know I'm paranoid about the people I meet Why are they talkin' to me? And why can't anyone see I just wanna live Don't really care about the things that they say Don't really care about what happens to me I just wanna live (Just wanna live Just wanna live just wanna live just wanna live) Just wanna live just wanna live  I rock a lawsuit when I'm going to court A white suit when I'm gettin' divorced A black suit at the funeral home And my birthday suit when I'm home alone Talkin' on the phone Got an interview with the rolling stone They're saying \"Now you're rich and now you're famous And fake ass girls all know your names and Lifestyles of the rich and famous Was your first hit aren't you ashamed? Of the life of the life Of the life we're livin' REPEAT CHORUS (at the end hit F four times instead of the whole \"just wanna live\" part)"
