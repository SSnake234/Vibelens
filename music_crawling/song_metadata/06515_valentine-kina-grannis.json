  "lyrics": "Love, it's a special day. We should celebrate, and appreciate That you and me found something pretty neat And I know some say this day is arbitrary But it's a good excuse to put our love to use Baby I know what to do, baby I, I will love you I'll love you, I'll love you. Love, I don't need those things I don't need no ring I don't need anything But you with me, cause in your company I feel happy oh so happy and complete And it's a good excuse to put our love to use Baby I know what to do, baby I, I will love you I'll love you, I'll love you. And it's a good excuse to put our love to use Baby I know what to do, baby I, I will love you I'll love you, I'll love you. So wont you be my honey bee Giving sweet kisses all the time Be mine, be my valentine So wont you be my honey bee Giving sweet kisses all the time Be mine, be my valentine Oh oh oh oh oh Be my valentine"
