My lover's got humour , she's the giggle at a funeral Knows everybody's disap proval I should've worshipped her sooner If the Heavens ever did speak she is the last true mouthpiece Every Sunday's getting more bleak A fresh poison each week We were born sick, ' you heard them say it My church offers no ab- solutes She tells me 'worship in the bedroom The only heaven I'll be sent to Is when I'm alone with you I was born sick, but I love it command me to be well A- men, A- men, , A- men Take me to church I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife Offer me that death- less death Good God, let me give you my life  Take me to church I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife Offer me that death- less death Good God, let me give you my life  2. If I'm a pagan of the good times my lover's the sunlight To keep the Goddess on my side she demands a sacri- fice To drain the whole sea get something shiny something meaty for the main course that's a fine looking high horse What you got in the stable? we've a lot of starving faithful That looks tasty that looks plenty, this is hungry work Take me to church I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife Offer me that death- less death Good God, let me give you my life  Take me to church I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife Offer me that death- less death Good God, let me give you my life  No masters or kings when the ritual be- gins There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene Only then I am human Only then I am clean  A- men, A- men, , A- men"
