  "lyrics": "  Too many voices, too many noises Invisible wires keeping us apart So many choices, but they re all disappointments And they only seal me away from you Climb into our own private bubble Let s get into all kinds of trouble Slide over here let your hands feel the way There s no better method to communicate Girl stop your talking words just get in the way I ll be your man So baby come over from the end of the sofa I ll be your man, I ll be your man So many faces, staring at their shoelaces When all anyone wants is to be seen So tonight let s be honest We only want to be wanted And darling you got me wanting you Everything that Im trying to say Just sounds like a worn out cliche Slide over here let your hands feel the way There s no better method to communicate Girl stop your talking words just get in the way I ll be your man So baby come over from the end of the sofa I ll be your man, I ll be your man What are we all looking for? Someone we just cant ignore it s Real love dripping from my heart What are we all looking for? Slide over here let your hands feel the way There s no better method to communicate Girl stop your talking words just get in the way I ll be your man Slide over here let your hands feel the way There s no better method to communicate Girl stop your talking words just get in the way I ll be your man So baby come over from the end of the sofa I ll be your man, I ll be your man I ll be your man, I ll be your man I ll be your man, I ll be your man  "
