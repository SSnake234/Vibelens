  "lyrics": "1. Each day I live I want to be A day to give the best of me I'm only one but not alone My finest day is yet unknown I broke my heart for every gain To taste the sweet I faced the pain I rise and fall yet through it all This must remains Chorus: I want one moment in time When I'm more than I thought I could be When all of my dreams are a heart beat away And the answers are all up to me Give me one moment in time When I'm racing with desti- ny Then in that one moment of time I will feel, I will feel eterni- ty uhm 2. I've lived to be the very best I want it all, no time for less I've laid the plans, now lay the chance Here in my hands Chourus: Give me one moment in time When I'm more than I thought I could be When all of my dreams are a heart beat away And the answers are all up to me Give me one moment in time When I'm racing with desti- ny Then in that one moment of time I will feel, I will feel eterni- ty Bridge: You're a winner for life time If you seize that one moment in time Make it shine Chorus: Give me one moment in time When I'm more than I thought I could be When all of my dreams are a heart beat away And the answers are all up to me Give me one moment in time When I'm racing with destiny Then in that one moment of time I will be, I will be, I will be  free I will be, I will be free"
