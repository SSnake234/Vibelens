Will you come in after me? Would you share your flaws with me? Let me know.\" You told me, \"Thinking is all wrong Love will happen when it wants I know it hurts sometimes, but don't let it go.\" 'Cause I want you , I want you , I want, I want you 'Cause I want you , I want you , I want, I want you (You)"
