What did she say? What did you do without me? What did you do? Did you play games without me? What did you play? Did you think all this time that I wouldn't find out about you? That's right I heard the story over and over again Gee, it's swell to finally meet her other friends Who am I? Who am I? What are you even saying? I'm the loser of the game you didn't know you were playing! Let's play a nother game this time I get to win Lives on the line. Winner takes all Ready or not. Let's begin! That's right I heard the story over and over again Gee, it's swell to finally meet her other friends That's right I heard the story, don't really like how it ends Gee, it's swell to finally meet her other friends"
