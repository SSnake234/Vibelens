My heart is your home Nothing is as cold As running on your own So river don't you rush Maybe you should fall That's what rivers do 'cause when you're in love You don't mind a different view Things are looking up Oh river (river, river) Don't run (run, run) Don't run (river, river) Don't run (run, run) Oh river (river, river) Don't run (run, run) Don't run (river, river) From our love (run, run) Don't run from me river Don't run from me river river No don't run from me river Don't run from me river river No don't run from me river Don't run from me river river No don't run from me river Maybe you should fall That's what rivers do 'cause when you're in love You don't mind a different view Things are looking up Oh river (river, river) Don't run (run, run) Don't run (river, river) Don't run (run, run) Oh river (river, river) Don't run (run, run) Don't run (river, river) From our love (run, run) Don't run from me river Don't run from me river river No don't run from me river Don't run from me river river No don't run from me river Don't run from me river river No don't run from me river"
