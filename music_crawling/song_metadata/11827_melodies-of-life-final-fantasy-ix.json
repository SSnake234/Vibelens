  "lyrics": "A lone for a while I've been searching through the dark. For traces of the love you left in side my lonely heart. To weave by picking up the pieces that re main. Melodies of life -- love's lost re frain... (Đánh 1 lần và 1 lần nửa nửa theo nhạc của bài hát) Our paths they did cross, though I cannot say just why. We met, we laughed, we held on fast, and then we said good bye. And who'll hear the echoes of stories never told? Let them ring out loud till they un fold...... ..... ....... In my dearest memories... ..I see you reaching out to me. Though you're gone, ...I still be lieve that you can call out my name. A voice from the past, joining yours and mine. Adding up the layers of harmony. And so it goes, on and on. Melodies of life. To the sky beyond the fly ing birds --forever and beyond. .... .... .... ..... ..... ...... ..... ...... ...... ....... - - ...... ...... ....... ...... ...... ...... ....... So far and a way, see the bird as it fl ies by. Gliding through the shadows of the clouds up in the sky. I've laid my m emories and dr eams upon those wings. Le ave them now and see what to morrow brings. ..... In your dearest memories... ...do you remember loving me? Was it fate-- - that brought us close and now leaves me behind? A voice from the past, joining yours and mine. Adding up the layers of harmony. And so it goes, on and on. Melodies of life. To the sky beyond the fly ing bird --forever and... On /If I should leave this lonely world behind. Your voice will still re member our melody. Now I know we'll carry on. Melodies of life, Come circle round and grow deep in our hearts, as long as we remember."
