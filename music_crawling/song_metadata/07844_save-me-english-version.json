Here you don't exist No, it's dangerous and I'm lost, I'm ruining myself Save me, I can't Have no one to hold on to, hold on to Please listen closely to my heart Calling for you whenever it wants, And even though I've lost it all, You're my ray of hope inside the dark So give me your hand come and save me, save me, I need your love before I fall, fall So give me your hand come and save me, save me, I need your love before I fall, fall So give me your hand come and save me, save me, Oh oh save me me me So give me your hand come and save me, save me, Oh oh save me me me"
