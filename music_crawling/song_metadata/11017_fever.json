  "lyrics": "Never know how much I love you. Never know how much I care When you put your arms around me. I get a fever, that's so hard to bear You give me fever, when you kiss me. Fever when you hold me tight Fever, in the morning. Fever all through the night Sun lights up the daytime. Moon lights up the night I light up when you call my name and I know I'm gonna treat you right You give me fever, when you kiss me. Fever when you hold me tight Fever, in the morning. Fever all through the night Everybody gots the fever. That is something you all know Fever isn't such a new thing. Fever started long ago Romeo loved Juliet. Juliet, she felt the same When he put his arms around her he said \" Julie baby, you're my flame\" Thou givest fever, when he kisseth. Fever with thy flaming youth Fever, I'm a fire. Fever, yeah I burn for thou Captain Smith and Pocahontas had a very very mad affair When her daddy tried to kill him She said, \" daddy, oh, don't you dare!\" You give me fever with his kisses Fever when he holds me tight Fever, I'm his misses Daddy, won't you treat him right? Now you've listened to my story Here's a point that I have made Chicks were born to give you fever Be it fahrenheit or centigrade They give you fever, when you kiss them Fever, if you live, you learn Fever, 'till you sizzle What a lovely way to burn They give you fever, when you kiss them Fever, if you live and learn Fever, 'til you sizzle. What a lovely way to burn"
