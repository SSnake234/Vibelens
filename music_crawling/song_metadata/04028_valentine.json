  "lyrics": "If there were no words no where to speak I would still here you If there were no tears no way to feel inside I'd still feel for you And even if the sun refused to shine Even if romance ran out of rhyme You would still have my heart until the end of time You're all I need, my love, my Valentine All of my life I have been waiting for All you give to me You've open my eyes And shown me how to love unselfishly I've dreamed of this a thousand times before In my dreams I couldn't love you more I will give you my heart until the end of time You're all I need, my love, my Valentine And Even if the sun refused to shine Even if romance ran out of rhyme You would still have my heart until the end of time 'Cause all I need, is you, my Valentine Wohoooh! You're all I need, my love, my Valentine"
