Yeah ...  ...But I'm open, you're closed. ...Where I follow, you'll go. ...I worry I won't see your face. Light up again. Even the best fall down some times. Even the wrong words seem to rhyme. Out of the doubt that fills my mind. I somehow find. You and I collide.  ...I'm quiet you know. ...You make a first impression. ...Well, I've found I'm scared to know. I'm always on your mind. Even the best fall down some times. Even the stars refuse to shine. Out of the back you fall in time. I somehow find. You and I collide.  ___________ Don't stop here.  ___________ I lost my place.  ___________ I'm close behind.  x2 Even the best fall down some times. Even the wrong words seem to rhyme. Out of the doubt that fills your mind. You finally find. You and I collide. You finally find. You and I collide. You finally find. You and I collide. "
