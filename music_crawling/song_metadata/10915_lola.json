Oh, Lola, Lola, hey I love drama and rumors. I like talking my shit Can't stop cuttin' people off. Get my scissors, lil' bitch I just keep laughin' at your pain, no Novocaine Need a padded room and chains, I'm out my brain Might need a straight jacket 'Cause all my thoughts are doin' backflips Look, I'm pretty, I'm petty, I pop like confetti 'Cause shit can get deadly, so don't make me jelly I been on my worse, I let bridges burn You hoes never learn, you scared, go to church Don't open your mouth, I'm a jawbreaker Been in car chases, I'm a lawbreaker I'm insane, might regret it later But don't you love my bad behavior? (Yeah) You love how I hold grudges Might throw some punches But you're not judgin', I'm your psycho You love how I talk crazy, then call you \" Baby\" No, you can't tame me, I'm your type, so I'm saying, hey, Lola She can get a little jealous, oh, loca She can be a drama, but her soul is pure Drowns in tears, but keeps on shi ning Just keep on shi ning. Oh, Lola, Lola, hey Lola She can get a little jealous, oh, loca She can be a drama, but her soul is pure Drowns in tears, but keeps on shi ning Just keep on shi ning. Oh, Lola, Lola, hey I'm a angel and a demon Happy when I act the meanest I think like all my nights are sleepless This feels like paradise and dreamin' He said, \" Lola, girl, you're evil'' Well, maybe you the reason If I'm a live, it's killing season Might choke you 'til you're barely breathin' Look, I'm loca, la vida loca, no controlla I'm colder than Nova Scotia, Minnesota Ain't sober, don't get me started Got a motor, my motive is bipolar, thought I told ya Cutthroat, yeah, I'm hard to handle Got a short fuse, don't light my candle Might tell a lie just to start a scandal I'm a loose cannon with a lot of ammo (Yeah) You love how I hold grudges Might throw some punches But you're not judgin', I'm your psycho You love how I talk crazy, then call you \" Baby\" No, you can't tame me, I'm your type, so I'm saying, hey, Lola She can get a little jealous, oh, loca She can be a drama, but her soul is pure Drowns in tears, but keeps on shi ning Just keep on shi ning. Oh, Lola, Lola, hey Lola She can get a little jealous, oh, loca She can be a drama, but her soul is pure Drowns in tears, but keeps on shi ning Just keep on shi ning. Oh, Lola, Lola, hey Lola, I don't blame you I'm the same as you Just don't let 'em change you Or tighten up your screws Yeah, I'ma do it my way or the highway Lookin' at you sideways in a valet Always thought the wrong way was the right way Like to see my side piece on a Sunday Na na na, slow down, slow down La la la, my play ground, playground Yeah, I'ma do it my way or the highway Lookin' at you sideways in a valet Always thought the wrong way was the right way Like to see my side piece on a Sunday I'm saying, hey, Lola She can get a little jealous, oh, loca She can be a drama, but her soul is pure Drowns in tears, but keeps on shi ning Just keep on shi ning. Oh, Lola, Lola, hey Lola She can get a little jealous, oh, loca She can be a drama, but her soul is pure Drowns in tears, but keeps on shi ning Just keep on shi ning. Oh, Lola, Lola, hey"
