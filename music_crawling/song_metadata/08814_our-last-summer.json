  "lyrics": "  I can still recall, our last summer still see it all Walks along the Seine, laughing in the rain Our last summer, memories that remain We made our way along the river And we sat down in the grass by the Eiffel tower I was so happy we had met It was the age of no regret Ohhhh yes Those crazy years that was the time Of the flower- power But underneath We had a fear of flying Of growing old A fear of slowly dying We took our chance Like we were dancing our last dance I can still re call, our last summer I still see it all In the tourist jam, Round the Notre Dame Our last summer, walking hand in hand Paris restaurants, our last summer Morning croissants Living for the day, worries far away Our last summer, we could laugh and play And now you're working in a bank A family man, a football fan And your name is Harry How dull it seems Are you the hero of my dreams I can still recall, our last summer I still see it all In the tourist jam, round the Notre Dame Our last summer, walking hand in hand I can still recall, our last summer I still see it all Walks along the Seine, laughing in the rain Our last summer, memories that remain"
