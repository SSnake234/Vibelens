  "lyrics": "We're soaring, flying There's not a star in heaven that we can't reach If we're trying So we're breaking free. You know the world can see us In a way that's different than who we are. Creating space between us Till we're separate hearts But your faith it gives me strength, Strength to believe.. We're breaking free We're soaring, flying There's not a star in heaven that we can't reach If we're trying Yeah we're breaking free Oh we're breaking free, ooooh Can you feel it building? Like a wave the ocean just can't control Collected by a feeling Ooh in our very soul. ( very soul) Rising till it lifts us up So everyone can see. We're breaking free We're soaring, flying There's not a star in heaven that we can't reach If we're trying Yeah we're breaking free Oh we're breaking free, oooh. Running, climbing, to get to the place to be all that we can be. Now's the time, So we're breaking free. We're breaking free, ooh yeah More than hope, more than faith, This is true, this is fate, And together we see it coming. More than you, more than me Not a want but in need Both of us, breaking free Soaring, flying There's not a star in heaven that we can't reach. If we're trying Yeah we're breaking free ( breaking free) We're running, ooh climbing to get to that place to be all that we can be. Now's the time (now's the time) So we're breaking free. Ohhh we're breaking free You know the world can see us In a way that's different than who we are."
