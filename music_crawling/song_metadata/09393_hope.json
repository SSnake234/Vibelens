You're heart's a trick And all the magic we felt was just a hit Hot and heavy whiskey good byes Boy you know how to make a girl cry Was sleeping in a bed full of lies and Now that I'm older I can see why Made me feel high cuz you had me so low, low low low You only seemed tall cuz you stunted my grow grow growth I only wanted you cuz I couldn't have u Now that I know that wasn't love that wasn't love That was just hope"
