  "lyrics": "Intro:  Toro, I am humble, for tonight I understand Your royal blood was never meant to decorate this sand You've suffered great injustice, so have thousands before you I offer an apology, and one long overdue I am sorry Toro I am sorry, Hear my song, and know I sing the truth Although we were bred to fight, I reach for kindness in your heart tonight And if you can forgive, and if you can forgive, love can truly live And if you can forgive, and if you can forgive, love can truly live Toro, I am frightend, but I'll use my final breath To tell you that I'm sorry, let us end this dance of death Two centuries of agony, that to your heart we sent Here and now with my amends, the senseless killing ends I am sorry, Toro I am sorry, Hear my song, and know I sing the truth Although we were bred to fight, I reach for kindness in your heart tonight And if you can forgive, and if you can forgive, love can truly live And if you can forgive, and if you can forgive, love can truly live And if you can forgive, and if you can forgive, love... Love will truly live"
