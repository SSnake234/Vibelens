  "lyrics": "tone Rain washed away the sun, slipping on sadness Pains cut deep in my lips, I’m so desperate Our first time in the rain my heart raced for your glance Love built up by the rain I realized So perfectly we match but no we’re not in love “So what am I to you?” just let me know babe So helpless as I was when I heard what you said That you’d never love me in the same way... Could you stop worryin’ ‘bout me when I’m still in love Though it’s not getting better when you’re not around I can’t help but say goodbye, moving on with a smile Leaving behind those times , those feelings that you gave Looking up to the sky of love I made for you What I see is a sky with dark clouds in a storm Young buds waiting underneath , like I used to be What’s left after the rain is this cold pure soul..."
