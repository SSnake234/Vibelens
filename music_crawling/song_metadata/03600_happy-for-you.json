Can’t help but wonder Are you ready, are you ready, are you ready now Do you forgive me am I something you can talk about I heard you’re moving on and now Well i’m happy, I’m happy, I’m happy for you Are you really gonna tell me that you’re better now Hey, ain’t it funny how we swore we couldn’t live without Each other, now you got another got it figured out Well I’m happy, I’m happy, I’m happy for you  Happy for you Just wanna be happy too Một trái tim nhớ thương đợi chờ Chờ giấc mơ bên em trở về Em nơi nào Em nơi nào Dù chúng ta đã không còn gì Hồi ức xưa nay vẫn còn đây Em nơi nào Em nơi nào ...Vấn vương toàn niềm đau Are you ready, are you ready, are you ready now Do you forgive me am I something you can talk about I heard you’re moving on and now Well i’m happy, I’m happy, I’m happy for you Are you really gonna tell me that you’re better now Hey, ain’t it funny how we swore we couldn’t live without Each other, now you got another got it figured out Well I’m happy, I’m happy, I’m happy for you  Happy for you Just wanna be happy too I’ve lived with all this Long enough, long enough Don’t you still wonder If it could’ve been us Are you ready, are you ready, are you ready now Do you forgive me am I something you can talk about I heard you’re moving on and now I’m happy, I’m happy, I’m happy for you Are you really gonna tell me that you’re better now Hey, ain’t it funny how we swore we couldn’t live without Each other, now you got another got it figured out Well I’m happy, I’m happy, I’m happy for you  Happy for you Just wanna be happy too"
