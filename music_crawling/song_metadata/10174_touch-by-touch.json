When I feel the time is right and your staying by my side And the love you give to me makes my heart beat When my fantasy fly away but my feelings make me stay I see the fire in your eyes, it makes my heart beat. Chorus: Do it, we'll still do it night and day You're my all time lover Do it, we'll still do it any- way Like there is no other Touch by touch, you're my all time lover Skin to skin, come undone my cover . (X2)  2. When my heart full of love it makes me a turtle in dove Love the game that we play night and day When our love is clear and bright it's our way to see the light There's a fire in our heart night and day"
