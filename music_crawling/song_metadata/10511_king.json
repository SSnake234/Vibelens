They say it's easy to leave you behind I don't wanna try  Cut cover, take that test Hold courage to your chest Don't wanna wait for you Don't wanna have to lose All that I've compromised to feel another high I've got to keep it down tonight And oh, oh, oh I was a king under your control And oh, oh, oh I wanna feel like you've let me go So let me go  All that I've compromised to feel another high I've got to keep it down tonight I had to break myself to carry on No love and no admission Take this from me tonight Oh, let's fight Oh, let's fight Oh, let's fight Oh And oh, oh, oh I was a king under your control And oh, oh, oh I wanna feel like you've let me go So let me go  Let go, let go, let go of everything Let go, let go, let go of everything Let go, let go, let go of everything Let go, let go, let go of everything"
