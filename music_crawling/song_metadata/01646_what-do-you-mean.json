Oh oh Oh What do you mean? Said we’re running out of time What do you mean? Oh oh oh What do you mean? Better make up your mind What do you mean? You’re so indecisive of what I’m saying Trying to catch the beat, make up your heart. Don't know if you're happy, or complaining. Don’t want for us to end where do I start First you wanna go to the left and you want to turn right Wanna argue all day, making love all night. First you up and you’re down and then between Ohh I really want to know… What do you mean? Oh When you nod your head yes But you wanna say no What do you mean? Hey When you don't want me to move But you tell me to go What do you mean? What do you mean? Said we’re running out of time What do you mean? oh oh oh What do you mean ? Better make up your mind What do you mean? You’re overprotective when I’m leaving Trying to compromise but I can’t win You wanna make a point but you keep preaching You had me from the start won’t let this end First you wanna go to the left then you want to turn right Wanna argue all day make love all night First you up and you’re down then you're between Ohh I really want to know… What do you mean? Ooh.. When you nod your head yes But you wanna say no. What do you mean? When you don’t want me to move But you tell me to go What do you mean? I wanna know hoo Oh what do you mean? Said you’re running out of time What do you mean? (ah baby) Oh oh oh what do you mean? Better make up your mind What do you mean? When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no What do you mean? Heyyy, when you don't want me to move, But you tell me to go What do you mean? What do you mean? Said we're running out of time What do you mean? Oh oh oh what do you mean? Better make up your mind What do you mean?"
