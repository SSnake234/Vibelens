Stay a little longer if you convince me Every time we make up, the truth is faded Everybody's blind when the view's amazin' Damn, who are we right now? Can we have a little conversation?

Maybe we're used to this Tell me, what are we to do Chasin' pain with an excuse I love that shit and so do you But don't break your back for me I'll put you out of your misery Tell me that it's all okay (tell me that it's all okay) I've been waitin' on this all damn day (waitin' on this all damn day) Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went I'm here, but don't count on me to stay Mr. Andrew Watt, ladies and gentlemen     Tell me that it's all okay (tell me that it's all okay) I've been waitin' on this all damn day (waitin' on this all damn day) Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went I'm here, but don't count on me to stay"
