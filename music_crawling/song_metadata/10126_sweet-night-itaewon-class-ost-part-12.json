Feels like a river's rushing through my mind I wanna ask you if this is all just in my head My heart is pounding tonight, I wonder If you are too good to be true And would it be alright if I Pulled you closer How could I know One day, I'd wake up feeling more But I had already reached the shore Guess we were ships in the night, night, night Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah We were ships in the night, night, night"
