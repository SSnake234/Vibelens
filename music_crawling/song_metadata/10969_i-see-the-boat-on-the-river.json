  "lyrics": "He left on a boat just to follow a dream He had to find. You can't hold a man when he follows a dream That's on his mind. I see a boat on the river, It's sailing a way Down to the ocean, Where to I can't say. Boat on the river, It's sailing a way Down to the ocean, Where to I can't say. I waited for him such a very long time, Don't know what for 'Cause I should have known when he left on the boat We'll meet no more. I see a boat on the river, It's sailing a way Down to the ocean, Where to I can't say. Boat on the river, It's sailing a way Down to the ocean, Where to I can't say. Boat on the river. You're bound for the sea, If you should find him Please greet him from me. There were people who came and said it's really a shame, Why did he take off to follow just a dream. But I guess they were wrong, In life you're sailing along And things don't turn out as simple as they seem. Boat on the river, It's sailing a way Down to the ocean, Where to I can't say. I see a boat on the river, It's sailing a way Down to the ocean, Where to I can't say. Boat on the river, It's sailing a way Down to the ocean, Where to I can't say. Boat on the river. You're bound for the sea, If you should find him Please greet him from me."
