  "lyrics": "We could share a crepe sucree At this parisian cafe Take a break and smell these flowers Underneath te Eiffel Tower Won't you share a creme brulee with me? How perfect could this be? In the city of love (In the city of love) In the city of love (In the city of love) We could try some fancy cheese Or peruse the galleries Isn't this a perfect day? How do I look in this beret? Oh, how can he not feel the same way When we're strolling down the Champs-Elysees In the city of love (In the city of love) I wish that he would whisper \"Ma cherie, je t'aime\" But all he wants to do is Try to fix that plane In the city of love (In the city of love) In the city of love (In the city of love) In the city of love."
