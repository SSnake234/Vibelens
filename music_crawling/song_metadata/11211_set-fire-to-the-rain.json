  "lyrics": "  I let it fall, my heart, And as it fell you rose to claim it. It was dark and I was over, Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands they're strong, but my knees were far too weak, Stand in your arms without fall to your your feet, But there's a side to you that I never knew, I never knew. All the things you'd say, they where never true, never true, And the games you'd play, you would always, always win. But I set fire to the rain, Watch it pour as I touched your face, Let it burn while I cry, Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name When I'm with you I could stay there, Close my eyes, feel you're here forever, You and me together, nothing is better But there's a side to you that I never knew, I never knew. All the things you'd say, they where never true, never true, And the games you'd play, you would always, always win. But I set fire to the rain, Watch it pour as I touched your face, well it burned while I cry, Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name I set fire to the rain And I threw us into the flames Where I felt something die, Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door, That heart you caught, must be waiting for you, Even now when we're already over, I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain, Watch it pour as I touch your face, Let it burn when I cry, Cause I heard it screaming your name, your name I set fire to the rain, And I threw us into the flames Where I felt something die, Cause I knew that was the last time, the last time, oh, oh Let it burn! Let it burn! "
