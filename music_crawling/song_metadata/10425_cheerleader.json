Do you think I'm pretty? Do I make you feel like cheating and I'm like no, not really cause Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader She is always right there when I need her Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader She is always right there when I need her She walks like a model, she grants my wishes like a genie in a bottle, yeah yeah Cause I'm the wizard of love and I got the magic wand All these other girls are tempting, but I'm empty when you're gone and they say Do you need me? Do you think I'm pretty? Do I make you feel like cheating and I'm like no, not really cause Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader She is always right there when I need her Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader She is always right there when I need her She gives me love and affection, baby did I mention you're the only girl for me, no I don't need a next one Mama loves you too, she thinks I made the right selection Now all that's left to do is just for me to pop the question Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader She is always right there when I need her Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader She is always right there when I need her"
