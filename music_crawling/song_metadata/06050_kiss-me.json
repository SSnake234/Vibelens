I'm fallin for your eyes, But they don't know me yet. And the feelin,I forget, Kiss me like you wanna be loved, Wanna be loved, Wanna be loved. This Feels like falling inlove, falling inlove, falling inlove. Settle down with me, And I'll be your safety, I'll be your lady. Coz i was made to keep your body warm, But I'm as cold as the wind blows, So hold me in your arms. Coz your hearts against my chest, Lips pressed to my neck. I'm fallin for your eyes, But they don't know me yet. And the feelin,I forget, Kiss me like you wanna be loved, Wanna be loved, Wanna be loved. This Feels like falling inlove, falling inlove, falling inlove.  x2 Coz i've been feelin everything, love to lust, lust to truth, I guess thats how i know you, Kiss me like you wanna be loved, Wanna be loved, Wanna be loved. This Feels like falling inlove, falling inlove, falling inlove Kiss me like you wanna be loved, Wanna be loved, Wanna be loved. This Feels like falling inlove, falling inlove, falling inlove..."
