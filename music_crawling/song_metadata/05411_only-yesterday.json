  "lyrics": "After long enough of being alone Everyone must face their share of loneliness In my own time nobody knew The pain I was goin' through And waitin' was all my heart could do Hope was all I had until you came Maybe you can't see how much you mean to me You were the dawn breaking the night The promise of morning light Filling the world surrounding me When I hold you things will be all right Free as a song, singin' forever Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely You showed me the way to leave the past And all its tears behind me Tomorrow maybe even brighter than today Since I threw my sadness away Only yester day I have found my home here in your arms Nowhere else on earth I'd really rather be Life waits for us, share it with me The best is about to be And so much is left for us to see When I hold you"
