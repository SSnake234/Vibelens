We'll always save the day And if you think we can't. We'll always find a way That's why the people of this world be lieve in Garnet, Ame thyst, and Pearl and Steven! If you could only know, what we really are When we ar rived on Earth, from out beyond your star We were a mazed to find, your beauty and your worth And we will pro tect your kind, And we will protect your Earth And we will protect your Earth, and we will protect you! I will fight for the place where I'm free! To live together and e xist as me! I will fight in the name of Rose Quartz! And everything that she believed in! I will fight for the world I was made in! The Earth is every thing I've ever known! I will fight to be everything That everybody wants me to be when I'm grown! The odds are a gainst us, this won't be easy But we're not going to do it a lone! We are the Crystal Gems! We'll always save the day And if you think we can't. We'll always find a way That's why the people of this world Be lieve in. Garnet, Ame thyst, and Pearl and S teven!"
