  "lyrics": "You would not believe your eyes If ten million fireflies lit up the world as i fell asleep 'Cause they'd fill the open air and leave teardrops everywhere you'd think me rude but I'd just stand and stare I'd like to make myself believe that planet Earth turns slowly Its hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep 'Cause everything is never as it seems 'Cause id get a thousand hugs from ten thousand lightning bugs I'd like to make myself believe that planet Earth turns slowly Its hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep 'Cause everything is never as it seems When i fall asleep leave my door open just a crack please take me away from here 'Cause i feel like such an insomniac please take me away from here) I'd like to make myself believe that planet Earth turns slowly Its hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep 'Cause everything is never as it seems"
