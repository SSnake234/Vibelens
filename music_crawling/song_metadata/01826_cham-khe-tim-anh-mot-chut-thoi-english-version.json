  "lyrics": "tone Lightly touch my eyes And touch my shoulders Lightly touch my lips Tomorrow, we will part Lightly touch my mind Lightly touch my dream We lightly touched in our innocent days I love my little girl Who believed in the songs That crying in the rain will sooth the pain I love that little girl Who believed in fantasies That our hands will keep holding till the end of time Time will take away our innocence and hurried dreams then Leaving random pains and no wonder. One day if you feel the pain in your chest when you're missing me Then don't you cry, just hold my hand where you feel safe... Don't kiss if our sweet aftertaste still lingers on your lips Don't you hug him if he can't give you your peace. Don't you believe in him if he says that he doesn't deserve you And don't you cry, I'm always here to hold you tight. Lightly touch my heart and then, we will part﻿..."
