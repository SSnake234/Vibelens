  "lyrics": "B:xx4440  G#m:4x4400 :022100 :044300 Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Full moon, bedroom, stars in your eyes Last night, the first time that I realized The glow between us felt so right We sat on the edge of the bed and you said \"I never knew that I could feel this way\" Love today can be so difficult 'Cause when I'm with you the world stops turning Could I love you any more? Could I love you any more? Could I love you any more? Sunrise, time flies, feels like a dream Being close in healing heart to believe Seven billion people in the world Only this wonder remains Could I love you any more? Could I love you any more? Could I love you any more? Softly, slowly Love unfolding Could this love be true? Could I love you any more? Could I love you any more? Could I love you any more? Could I love you any more? (Question's rhetorical) Could I love you any more? (Oh, this feels phenomenal) Could I love you any more? (Love is all there is) Could I love you any more? (It's inexhaustible) Could I love you any more? (Oh, love is unstoppable) Could I love you any more? (Love is all there is) Softly, slowly Love unfolding Could this love be true? Could I love you any more? Could I love you any more? Could I love you any more? (Fade out)"
