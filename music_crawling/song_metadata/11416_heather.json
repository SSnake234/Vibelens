I'm not even half, as pretty You gave her your sweater It's just polyester, but you like her better Wish I were Heather Watch as she stands with Put your arm 'round her shoulder But how could I hate her? But then again, kinda Wish she were dead, as she Walks by Sore eyes Blue sky Mesmerized While I die Why would you ever kiss me? I'm not even half, as pretty You gave her your sweater It's just polyester, but you like her better I wish I were Heather   Why would you ever kiss me? I'm not even half as pretty You gave her your sweater It's just polyester, but you like her better Wish I were"
