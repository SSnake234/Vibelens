Maybe then you'd know me 'Cause I've had every thing But no one's listen ing And that's just fucking lonely I'm so lo-o-o-one ly Lo-o-o-one ly Everybody knows my past now Like my house was always made of glass And maybe that's the price you pay And everybody saw me sick And it felt like no one gave a shit They criticized the things I did as an idiot kid What if you had it all but nobody to call? Maybe then you'd know me 'Cause I've had every thing But no one's listen ing And that's just fucking lonely I'm so lo-o-o-one ly Lo-o-o-one ly I'm so lo-o-o-one ly Lo-o-o-one ly"
