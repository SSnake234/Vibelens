(hoặc ) Tiptoe from the garden By the garden of the willow tree And tiptoe through the tulips with me  Knee deep in flowers we'll stray We'll keep the showers away And if I kiss you in the garden in the moonlight Will you pardon me And tiptoe through the tulips with me       Knee deep in flowers we'll stray We'll keep the showers away And if I kiss you in the garden in the moonlight Will you pardon me And tiptoe through the tulips with me  "
