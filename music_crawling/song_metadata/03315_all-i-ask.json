I don't need Your honesty it's already in your eyes and I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me No one knows me like you do and since you're the only one that matters tell me, who do I run to? Look, don't get me wrong, I know There is no tomorrow All I ask is If this is my last night with you hold me like I'm more than just a friend give me a memory I can use take me by the hand while we do what lovers do it matters how this ends 'Cause what If I never love again? Let this be our lesson in love let this be the way we remember us I don't want to be cruel or vicious And I ain't asking for forgiveness All I ask is If this is my last night with you hold me like I'm more than just a friend give me a memory I can use take me by the hand while we do what lovers do it matters how this ends 'Cause what If I never lo... ve again"
