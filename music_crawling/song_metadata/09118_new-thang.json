It's a go-pro?, So I can watch that back, HD- Slo-mo I don't care if it's the first date, I'll take ya back to my place We can skip first base, Cuz a playa like me, tryna slide into home plate Clap clap, make it clap, Lights on, lights off Make it clap, Yeah, Make it clap, My name ain't Santa, but she sittin' on my lap. Ooh, the way that you pop, girl Makes me go crazy, show me what you got, girl, you could be my new thang Oh, the way that you move Makes me go crazy, pick it up now drop girl, you could be my new thang Get saxy, girl, get saxy Get saxy, girl, get saxy Get saxy, girl, get saxy I heard that ya single, Now ya talkin' my lingo, Let's play casino, Bring four friends plus you Bingo! Ye ain't nuttin' but a flirt, The way ya bouncin' in that shirt It's amaxin' how ya drop it, Pick it up and still make it work Yo body lethal, I might LA freak ya, Goddamit, that booty fast Sittin' high up on yo back, What the heck did they feed ya? Clap clap, make it clap, Lights on, lights off Make it clap, Yeah, Make it clap, My name ain't Apple, but they call me the Mac Ooh, the way that you pop, girl Makes me go crazy, show me what you got, girl, you could be my new thang Oh, the way that you move Makes me go crazy, pick it up now drop girl, you could be my new thang Get saxy, girl, get saxy Get saxy, girl, get saxy Get saxy, girl, get saxy"
