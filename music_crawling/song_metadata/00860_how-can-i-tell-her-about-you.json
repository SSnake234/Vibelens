  "lyrics": "1. She knows when I'm lonesome. She cries when I'm sad She's up in the good times. she's down in the bad And whenever I'm dis couraged. She knows just what to do But girl, she doesn't know about you 2. I can tell her my troubles. She makes them all seem right I can make up ex- cuses. Not to hold her at night We can talk of tomor- row. I'll tell her things I want to do But girl, A how can I tell her about you? Chorus: How can I A tell her about you? Girl, please tell me what to do Everything seems right, when ever I'm with you So girl, won't you tell me, how to tell her about you  3. How can I tell her I don't miss her, Whenever I'm away? How can I say it's you I think of. Every single night and day? But when is it easy, telling someone we're through? Ah girl, help me tell her about you"
