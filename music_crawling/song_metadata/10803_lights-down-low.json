Under heavy skies in the rain In your bare feet Grab my hand and we're chasing the train I catch you looking back at me Can I stop the flow of time Can I swim in your divine Cause I don't I think I'd ever Ooh oh Turn the lights, turn the lights Down low Yeah Now I'm feeling you, breathing slow Cause baby we're just reckless kids Trying to find an island in the flood Ooh oh Turn the lights, turn the lights Down low     And I will give you everything baby Can you feel this energy take it You can have the best me baby And I will give you anything Can you feel this energy take it You can have the best of me baby. Ooh oh Turn the lights, turn the lights Down low Yeah Now I'm feeling you, breathing slow Ooh oh Turn the lights, turn the lights Down low Yeah Now I'm feeling you, breathing slow Cause baby we're just reckless kids Trying to find an island in the flood Ooh oh Turn the lights, turn the lights Down low oh.
