Oh no, no, I can't take it Baby every place I go reminds me of you Do you think of me? Of what we used to be? Is it better now that I'm not around? My friends are actin' strange, they don't bring up your name Are you happy now? Are you happy now? I don't wanna know, know, know, know Who's taking you home, home, home, home I'm loving you so, so, so, so I don't wanna know, know, know, know Who's taking you home, home, home, home I'm loving you so, so, so, so And every time I go out, yeah I hear it from this one, I hear it from that one, glad you got someone new yeah I see but I don't believe it Even in my head you're still in my bed, maybe I'm just a fool Do you think of me? Of what we used to be? Is it better now that I'm not around? My friends are actin' strange, they don't bring up your name Are you happy now? Are you happy now? I don't wanna know, know, know, know Who's taking you home, home, home, home I'm loving you so, so, so, so I don't wanna know, know, know, know Who's taking you home, home, home, home I'm loving you so, so, so, so No more \"please stop\" No more hashtag boo'd up screenshots No more tryin' make me jealous on your birthday Do he do you like this, do he woo you like this? Do he let it down for you, touch your poona like this? Matter fact, never mind, we'll let the past be I don't wanna know, know, know, know Who's taking you home, home, home, home I'm loving you so, so, so, so I don't wanna know, know, know, know Who's taking you home, home, home, home I'm loving you so, so, so, so I don't wanna know, know, know, know Who's taking you home, home, home, home I'm loving you so, so, so, so I don't wanna know, know, know, know Who's taking you home, home, home, home I'm loving you so, so, so, so  "
