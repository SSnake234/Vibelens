  "lyrics": "tone A broken heart is all that's left I'm still fixing all the cracks Lost a couple of pieces when I carried it, carried it, carried it home I'm afraid of all I am My mind feels like a foreign land Silence ringing inside my head Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home I spent all of the love I've saved We were always a losing game Small-town boy in a big arcade I got addicted to a losing game Ooh, ooh All I know, all I know Loving you is a losing game How many pennies in the slot Giving us up, didn't take a lot I saw the end 'fore it begun Still I carried, I carried, I carried on Ooh, ooh All I know, all I know Loving you is a losing game Ooh, ooh All I know, all I know Loving you is a losing game I don't need your games, game over Get me off this roller-coaster Ooh, ooh All I know, all I know Loving you is a losing game Ooh, ooh All I know, all I know Loving you is a losing game"
