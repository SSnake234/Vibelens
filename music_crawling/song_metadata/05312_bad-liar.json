Ooh you're taking all perfection out my mind Ooooh every time I watch you serpentine Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin' Not to think about you Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin' Not to give in to you And oh baby let's make reality, actuality, a reality Oh baby let's make reality, actuality, a reality Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin' Not to think about you Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin' Not to give in to you"
