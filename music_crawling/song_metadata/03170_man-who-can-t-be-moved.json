  "lyrics": "Going Back to the corner where I first saw you Gonna camp in my sleeping bag I'm not gonna move Got some words on cardboard, got your p icture in my hand Saying, \"If you see this girl can you tell her where I am?\" Some try to hand me money, they don't understand I'm not broke I'm just a broken hearted man I know it makes no sense but what else can I do How can I move on when I'm still in love with you Cos if one day you wake up and find that you're missin me And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be Thinkin maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street So I'm not moving , I'm not moving  Policeman says, \"Son you can't stay here\" I said, \"There's someone I'm waiting for if it's a day, a month, a year\" Gotta s tand my ground even if i t rains or snows If she changes her mind this is the first place she will go Cos if one day you wake up and find that you're missin me And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be Thinkin maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street So I'm not moving , I'm not moving People talk about the guy that's waiting on a girl There are no holes in his s hoes but a big hole in his world Maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved Maybe you wont mean to but you'll see me on the news And you'll come r unning to the cor ner 'cause you'll know it's just for you Cos if one day you wake up and find that you're missin me And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be Thinkin maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street So I'm not moving , I'm not moving Going back to the corner where I first saw you Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move"
