  "lyrics": "Do you know what it feels like loving someone that’s in a rush to throw you away. Do you know what it feels like to be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed. If birds flying south is a sign of changes At least you can predict this every year. Love, you never know the minute it ends suddenly I can’t get it to speak Maybe finding all the things it took to save us I could fix the pain that bleeds inside of me Look in your eyes to see something about me I’m standing on the edge and I don’t know what else to give. Do you know what it feels like loving someone that’s in a rush to throw you away. Do you know what it feels like to be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed. How can I love you How can I love you How can I love you How can I love you. . . . If you just don’t talk to me, babe."
