  "lyrics": "Sometimes I get so tired I've seen the great heights, Reminding me....I'm alive I don't wanna die , I don't wanna waste another day or night . I know there's something more , Than what we're living for , I see it in the stars I feel it the shores , I know there something , I know there something more . I don't wanna die, I don't wannw waste a nother day or night. (Nick siad:\"When I was ten years old I tried to commit suicide, I had lost my hope. I tried to drown myself but I couldn't do it. God had a plan for my life, to give hope to other people through my story.\") I don't wanna die, I don't wannw waste a nother day or night. I don't wanna die, I don't wannw waste a nother day or night. I don't wanna die, I don't wannw waste a nother day or night. I know there's something...somethin g...something...some thing..."
