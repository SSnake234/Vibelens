  "lyrics": "What if, what if we run away? What if, what if we left today? What if we say goodbye to safe and sound? And what if, what if we're hard to find? What if, what if we lost our mind? What if we let them fall behind, never found. And when the lights start flashing like a photobooth, And the stars exploding, we'll be fireproof. My youth, my youth is yours. Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls. My youth, my youth is yours. Run away now, and forevermore. My youth, my youth is yours. The truth's so loud you can't ignore, My youth, my youth, my youth, my youth is yours.  What if, what if we start to drive? What if, what if we close our eyes? What if we're speeding through red lights to paradise? 'Cause we've no time for getting on before our bodies turn to stones. Cross your fingers here we go, Oh, oh, oh. And when the lights start flashing like a photobooth, And the stars exploding, we'll be fireproof. My youth, my youth is yours. Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls. My youth, my youth is yours. Run away now, and forevermore. My youth, my youth is yours. The truth's so loud you can't ignore, My youth, my youth, my youth, my youth is yours.  My youth is yours.  My youth, my youth is yours. Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls. My youth, my youth is yours. Run away now, and forevermore. My youth, my youth is yours. The truth's so loud you can't ignore, My youth, my youth, my youth, my youth is yours.  My youth is yours.  My youth is yours.    My youth is yours."
