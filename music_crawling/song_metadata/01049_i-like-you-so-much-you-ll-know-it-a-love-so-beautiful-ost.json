  "lyrics": "I like your eyes, you look away when you pre tend not to care I like the dimples on the corners of the smile that you wear I like you more, the world may know but don't be scared Coz I'm falling deeper, baby be pre pared I like your shirt, I like your fingers, love the way that you smell to be your favorite jacket, just so I could always be near I loved you for so long, sometimes it's hard to bear But after all this time, I hope you wait and see Love you every minute, every second Love you everywhere and any moment Always and forever I know I can't quit you Coz baby you're the one, I don't know how Love you til the last of snow disappears Love you til a rainy day becomes clear Never knew a love like this, now I can't let go I'm in love with you, and now you know    I like the way you try so hard when you play ball with your friends, I like the way you hit the notes, in every song you're shining I love the little things, like when you're unaware I catch you steal a glance and smile so perfec tly Though sometimes when life brings me down You're the cure my love In a bad rainy day You take all the worries away Love you every minute, every second Love you everywhere and any moment Always and forever I know I can't quit you Coz baby you're the one, I don't know how In a world devoid of life, you bring color In your eyes I see the light, my future Always and forever with you, now I can't let you go I'm in love with you, and now you know"
