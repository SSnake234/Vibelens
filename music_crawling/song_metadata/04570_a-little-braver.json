  "lyrics": "  With December comes the glimmer on her face And I get a bit nervous, I get a bit nervous now In the twelve months on I haven't made friends with change So everything's perfect, can we start over again? The playgrounds they get rusty and your heart beats another ten thousand times Before I got the chance to say I missed you When it gets hard, I get a little stronger now I get a little braver now And when it gets dark, I get a little brighter now I get a little wiser now Before I give my heart away Well we met each other at the house of run away I remember it perfectly, we were running on honesty We moved together like a silver lock and key But now that your lock has changed, I know I can't fit that way The playgrounds they get rusty and your heart beats another ten thousand times before I got the chance to say I missed you When it gets hard, I get a little stronger now I get a little braver now And when it gets dark, I get a little brighter now I get a little wiser now Before I give my heart away When it gets hard, I get a little stronger now I get a little braver now And when it gets dark, I get a little brighter now I get a little wiser now Before I give my heart away"
