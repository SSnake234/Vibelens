All I want for Christmas is you  I don't want a lot for Christmas there is just one thing I need I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree I don't need to hang my stocking there upon the fireplace Santa Claus won't make me happy with a toy on Christmas day I just want you for my own more than you could ever know Make my wish come true... All I want for Christmas is you , you, baby I won't ask for much this Christmas I won't even wish for snow I'm just gonna keep on waiting underneath the mistletoe I won't even make a list and send it to the North Pole for Saint Nick I won't even stay awake to hear those magic reindeer click ' Cause I just want you here tonight holding on to me so tight What more can I do, Baby all I want for Christmas is you , you All the lights are shining so brightly everywhere And the sound of children laughter fills the air and everyone is singing I hear those sleigh bells swinging Santa won't you bring me the one I really need won't you please bring my baby to me Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas this is all I'm asking for I just want to see baby standing right outside my door Oh I just want him for my own more than you could ever know Make my wish come true, all I want for Christmas is you...  all I want for Christmas is you baby...X2"
