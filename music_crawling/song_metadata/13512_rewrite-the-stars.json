  "lyrics": "tone So don't keep saying our hands are tied You claim it's not in the cards But fate is pulling you miles away And out of reach from me But you're here in my heart So who can stop me if I decide What if we rewrite the stars? Say you were made to be mine Nothing could keep us apart You'd be the one I was meant to find It's up to you, and it's up to me No one can say what we get to be So why don't we rewrite the stars? Maybe the world could be ours Tonight  You think it's easy You think I don't want to run to you But there are mountains And there are doors that we can't walk through I know you're wondering why Because we're able to be Within these walls But when we go outside You're going to wake up and see that it was hopeless after all No one can rewrite the stars How can you say you'll be mine? Everything keeps us apart And I'm not the one you were meant to find It's not up to you It's not up to me When everyone tells us what we can be How can we rewrite the stars? Say that the world can be ours All I want is to fly with you All I want is to fall with you So just give me all of you How do we rewrite the s tars? Say you were made to be mine? Nothing can keep us apart Cause you are the one I was meant to find It's up to you And it's up to me No one can say what we get to be And why don't we rewrite the stars? Changing the world to be ours  You know I want you It's not a secret I try to hide But I can't have you"
