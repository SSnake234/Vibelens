Like theres noone e lse around just throw your hands up high Even when they try to t ake us down Lets have the time of our lives Till the lights burn o ut Lets laugh until we cry Life is only what you make it now D reamers don't care if its right R estless lets leave it a ll behind And Tonight C razy when you cros s my mind S o what lets just give this a try A lright L ooking back what are we wai ting for? T ake the chance Now is all we got fo r sure!"
