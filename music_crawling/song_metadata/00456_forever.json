  "lyrics": "I stand a- lone in the dark- ness The winter of my life came so fast Memories go back to child- hood To days I still re- call. Oh how happy I was then There was no sorrow there was no paint Walking through the green- fields Sun shines in my eyes I'm still there every- where I'm the durst in the wind I'm the star in the northern sky I'll never stay any- where I'm the wind in the trees Would you wait for me forever."
