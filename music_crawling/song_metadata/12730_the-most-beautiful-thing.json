Will it be my flat or your apartment When I finally realize I do? Will we meet on Baker Street Or find ourselves on Melrose Avenue? I don't know who you are But I'll save you a seat Hang my coat on the chair next to me I try to reassure the waiter Say you’re down the street He laughed at me So here’s to you The most beautiful thing that I have never seen  x2 Someone on a screen asked me a question Something about what loves means to me Maybe it’s just circumstance Or general compatibility I don't know who you are But I'll save you a seat Hang my coat on the chair next to me I try to reassure the waiter Say you’re down the street He laughed at me So here’s to you The most beautiful thing that I have never seen"
