Is it coming? Is it coming? Is it coming? Is it coming back? Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, yeah Your love is an abyss for my heart to eclipse, now Might be over now, but I feel it still Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now I been feeling it since 1966, now ...Might be over now, but I feel it still Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now Let me kick it like it's 1986, now ...Might be over now, but I feel it still"
