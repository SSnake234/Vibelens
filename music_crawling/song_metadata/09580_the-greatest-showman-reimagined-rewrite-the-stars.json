  "lyrics": "You know I want you It's not a secret I try to hide You know you want me So don't keep saying our hands are tied You claim it's not in the cards And faith is pulling you miles away And out of a reach from me But you're hearing my heart So who can stop me if I decide it's on my destiny? What if we rewrite the stars? Say you were made to be mine Nothing could keep us apart You'll be the one I was meant to find It's up to you, and it's up to me No one could say what we get to be So why don't we rewrite the stars? And maybe the world could be ours tonight  You think it's easy You think I don't wanna grow onto you, yeah But there are mountains (But there are mountains) And there are doors that we can't walk through I know you're wondering why Because we're able to be just you and me within these walls But when we go outside You're gonna wake up and see No one can rewrite the stars (Rewrite the stars) How can you say you'll be mine? Everything keeps us apart And I'm not the one you were meant to find It's not up to you, it's not up to me, yeah When everyone tells us what we can be (Tells us what we can) And how can we rewrite the stars? Say that the world can be ours tonight (Be ours) All I want is to fly with you All I want is to fall with you So just give me all of you And how do we rewrite the stars? Say you were made to be mine And nothing can keep us apart 'Cause you are the one I was meant to find It's up to you, and it's up to me No one could say what we get to be And why don't we rewrite the stars? Changing the world to be ours   You know I want you  It's not a secret I try to hide But I can't have you "
