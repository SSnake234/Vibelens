Last night I lost all my patience You were fucked up, I was wasted Midsummer madness I can't take it no more, no more Fuck the ru-u-u-ules Ru-u-u-u-oh Fuck the ru-u-u-ules Ru-u-u-u-oh 當光灑進了 white Porsche, yeah Call me DJ Knowknow, oh-oh no 你點頭我心裡會滿足 在天文台半山道漫步 Fuck the rules 為了這一刻的feel我值得飛了那麼久 把beautiful memories 存入我的iPhone X 看日落 粉的天 有藍月亮陪 Sunny gone, I don't care, you're my sunshine babe I don't feel control I'm better on your own I'm used to being so gone for way too long Long, long, long Rules, rules, rules Rules, rules, rules"
