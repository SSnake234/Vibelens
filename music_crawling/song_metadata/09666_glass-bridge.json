Tell me for sure That you won’t leave me here alone I need to know You will, I believe When I do need someone to hold You’ll be here  Little voice I hear, yeah maybe Maybe no, who’s to say Slowly drowning in after wave After wave, who to say Then I cross a bridge for Over million reasons to hold on Hide away with me Walk away with me Then we cross a bridge for Over million troubles to meet Nothing is easy Nothing is easy Huu hoo ho.. hoo ho Hoo ho.. Oh how well you see? How will you try, How? However I mean to you now Then I cross a bridge for Over million reasons to hold on Hide away with me Walk away with me Then we cross a bridge for Over million troubles to meet Nothing is easy Nothing is easy"
