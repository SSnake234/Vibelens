He- llo , it's me I was wondering if after all these years You'd like to meet to go over Every thing they say that time's supposed to heal yeah but I ain't done much healing He- llo , can you hear me? I'm in California dreaming about we used to be When we were younger and free I've for- gotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet There's such a diffe- rence bet- ween us And a milli- on miles Chorus: Hello from the other side I must've called a thousand times to tell you I'm sorry, for every- thing that I've done But when I call you never seem to be home. He- llo from the out- side At least I can say that I've tried to tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart, but it don't mat- ter it clearly doesn't tear you a- part any- more  2. He- llo , how are you? It's so typical of me to talk a- bout myself I'm sorry, I hope that you're well Did you ever make it out of that town Where nothing ever happened? It's no secret That the both of us are run- ning out of time. Chorus: Hello from the other side I must've called a thousand times to tell you I'm sorry, for every- thing that I've done But when I call you never seem to be home. He- llo from the out- side At least I can say that I've tried to tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart, but it don't mat- ter it clearly doesn't tear you a- part any- more * Oooo- ohh, any- more Oooo- ohh, any- more Oooo- ohh, any- more , any- more Chorus: Hello from the other side I must've called a thousand times to tell you I'm sorry, for every- thing that I've done But when I call you never seem to be home. He- llo from the out- side At least I can say that I've tried to tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart, but it don't mat- ter it clearly doesn't tear you a- part any- more  "
