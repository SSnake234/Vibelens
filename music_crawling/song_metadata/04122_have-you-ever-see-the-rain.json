  "lyrics": "Someone told me long ago There's a calm before the storm, I know And it's been coming for some time When it's over, so they say It'll rain a sunny day, I know Shining down like water I wanna know Have you ever seen the rain I wanna know Have you ever seen the rain Coming down on a sunny day Yesterday and days before Sun is cold and rain is hard, I know Been that way for all my time 'Til forever on it goes Thru the circle fast and slow, I know And it can't stop, I wonder I wanna know Have you ever seen the rain I wanna know Have you ever seen the rain Coming down on a sunny day I wanna know Have you ever seen the rain I wanna know Have you ever seen the rain Coming down on a sunny day"
