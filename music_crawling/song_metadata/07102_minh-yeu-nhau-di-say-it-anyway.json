  "lyrics": "You seem to have something to say Say it anyway And don’t you know how long I’ve waited for this day You’re so wonderful and kind You’re my peace of mind But if you hesitate, then when will we begin our love? How about we just learn to love against all odds Or to be sure, you can listen to my heart. So come close to me, can you feel it? One-2-3-5 Oh, did I just drop a beat? So it’s the missing piece that’s been always in my heart You gotta hold me now, only you can fill the part, And no matter how life will change There is no way anyone can replace “you” in “I love you” So say what you want to say Say it anyway And I will tell you how long I waited for today You’re my beautiful sunshine You’re my blue sky But don’t you hesitate ‘cause right now we begin our love Although we have spent so much time together It would never mean a thing if we don’t truly treasure, The moments we have for each other I promise you I will love you forever Spring, winter or fall It’s doesn’t really matter I will keep you warm, even warmer and summer To have you nearby, I’m satisfied From this day on, I officially call you~~ How about we just learn to love against all odds, or to be sure, you can listen to my heart."
