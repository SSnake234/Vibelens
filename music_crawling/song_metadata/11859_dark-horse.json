Boy you should know what you're falling for Baby do you dare to do this? Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse Are you ready for, ready for A perfect storm, perfect storm Cause once your mine, once your mine ... .... .. . x2 Mark my words This love will make you levitate Like a bird Like a bird without a cage But down to earth If you choose to walk away, don't walk away It's in the palm of your hand now baby It's a yes or no, no maybe So just be sure, before you give it up to me ,  up to me Give it up to me So you want to play with magic? Boy you should know what you're falling for Baby do you dare to do this? Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse Are you ready for, ready for A perfect storm, perfect storm Cause once your mine, once your mine ...

Damn I think I love her Shawty so bad I'm sprung and I don't care She got me like a roller coaster Turn the bedroom into a fair Her love is like a drug I was tryna' hit it and quit it But lil' mama so dope I messed around and got addicted So you want to play with magic? Boy you should know what you're (You should know) Baby do you dare to do this? Cause I'm coming at you like a (like a dark horse) Are you ready for, ready for A perfect storm, perfect storm (a perfect storm) Cause once your mine, once your mine ..Oh.."
