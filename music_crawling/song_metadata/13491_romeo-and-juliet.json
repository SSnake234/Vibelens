  "lyrics": " x4 A lovestruck Romeo sings the streets a serenade Laying everybody low with a love song that he made Finds a street light steps out into the shade Says something like you and me babe, how about it? Juliet says hey it's Romeo, you nearly gave me a heart attack He's underneath the window, she's singing hey la my boyfriends back you shouldn't come around here singing up to people like that Anyway, what you gonna do about it? Juliet the dice was loaded from the start And I bet, and you exploded in my heart. And I forget, I forget, the movie song When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong  Juliet?"
