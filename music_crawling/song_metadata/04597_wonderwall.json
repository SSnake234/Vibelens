And after all You're my wonder wal  Today is gonna be the day but they'll never throw it back to you By now you should've somehow realiz ed what you're not to do I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do About you now And all the roads that lead you there are winding And all the lights that light the way are blinding There are many things that I Would like to say to you, but I don't know how Cause maybe You're gonna be the one that saves me? And after all You're my wonder wal  Cause maybe You're gonna be the one that saves me? And after all You're my wonder wal  I said maybe You're gonna be the one that saves me? You're gonna be the one that saves me? You're gonna be the one that saves me? "
