And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit right to the top, Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check I don't ever want to let you down I don't ever want to leave this town 'Cause after all It's time to begin, isn't it? I get a little bit bigger, but then, I'll admit, I'm just the same as I was Now don't you understand  So this is where you fell, and I am left to sell the path that heaven runs through miles of clouded hell, right to the top Turning to rags and give the commodities a rain check I don't ever want to let you down I don't ever want to leave this town 'Cause after all It's time to begin, isn't it? I get a little bit bigger, but then, I'll admit, I'm just the same as I was Now don't you understand This road never looked so lonely, This house doesn't burn down slowly, to ashes, to ashes... It's time to begin, isn't it? I get a little bit bigger, but then, I'll admit, I'm just the same as I was Now don't you understand  "
