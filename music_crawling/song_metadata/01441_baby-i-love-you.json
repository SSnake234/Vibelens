I need to let you know I wanna say I love you, I wanna hold you tight I want your arms around me & I, want your lips on mine I wanna say I love you, but, babe I'm terrified My hands are shaking, my heart is raising Cause it's something I can't hide, it's something I can't deny So here I go... [Am]I 'v e never [F ]said, the se wo rd s to [C]anyone, [G]anyone at all Never got this close, cause I was always afraid I would falll But now i know , that I'll fall right into your arms... Don't ever let me go I wanna say I love you, I wanna hold you tight I want your arms around me & I , want your lips on mine I wanna say I love you, but, babe I'm terrified My hands are shaking, my heart is raisin' Cause it's something I can't hide, it's something I can't deny So here I go... Take it in, breathe the air What is there to really fear? I can't contain, what my heart's sayin' I gotta say it out loud... I wanna say I love you, I wanna hold you tight I want your arms around me & I , want your lips on mine I wanna say I love you, but, babe I'm terrified My hands are shaking, my heart is raisin' Cause it's something I can't hide, it's something I can't deny So here I go... Baby I lo-o-o-o-ve you"
