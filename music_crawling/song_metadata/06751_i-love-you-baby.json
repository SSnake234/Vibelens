  "lyrics": "Intro:    1. When I'm cold and lonesome inside Underneath the heavenly sky I wish upon a star, no matter where you are However near or far, just to see you tonight All alone, with nowhere to hide Up above the world oh so high I hope and pray someday although you're far away That you will feel the same as I do each and every night I love you baby, I know I always will As long as I live, I will be here for you And someday maybe, you'll say you love me, too The way I love you, there's nothing I won't do 2. There's no words to ever describe What I feel I cannot disguise But you will never know how much I love you so And I will always hold you so dear till the end of time Above the world oh so high You sparkle and shine Alone with nowhere to hide Oh heavenly sky."
