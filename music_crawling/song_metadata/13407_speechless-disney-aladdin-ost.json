  "lyrics": "Here comes a wave Meant to wash me away A tide that is taking me under Swallowing sand Left with nothing to say My voice drowned out in the thunder But I won't cry And I won't start to crumble Whenever they try To shut me or cut me down I won't be silenced You can't keep me quiet Won't tremble when you try it All I know is I won't go speechless 'Cause I'll breathe When they try to suffocate me Don't you underestimate me 'Cause I know that I won't go speechless Written in stone every rule every word Centuries old and unbending Stay in your place better seen and not heard Well now that story's ending Cause I, I cannot start to crumble So come on and try, try to shut me cut me down"
