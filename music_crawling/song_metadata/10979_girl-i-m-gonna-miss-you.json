  "lyrics": "I knew it from the start you would break my heart You rapped me 'round your itty bitty finger You kept me hangin' on a lovers cross a while Took my breath a way All the love I feel for you Nothing could make me change my point of view Giving all the love I feel for you You're leavin' Now I'm sittin' here, I'm wastin' my time I just don't know what I should do It's a tragedy for me to see the dream is over And I never will forget the day we met Girl, I'm gonna miss you Like a honey bee, you took the best of me Like a fairy tale, you are so unreal When you had a taste of paradise I'm gonna miss you Giving all the love I feel for you You're leavin' Now I'm sittin' here, I'm wastin' my time I just don't know what I should do It's a tragedy for me to see the dream is over And I never will forget the day we met Girl, I'm gonna miss you"
