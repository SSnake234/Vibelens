Dashing through the snow In a one-horse open sleigh Through the fields we go Laughing all the way Bells on bob-tail ring Making spirits bright What fun it is to ride and sing A sleighing song tonight Feliz navi dad Feliz navi dad Feliz navi dad Prospero anõ y felici dad Feliz navi dad Feliz navi dad Feliz navi dad Prospero anõ y felici dad I wanna wish you a merry Christmas I wanna wish you a merry Christmas I wanna wish you a merry Christmas From the bottom of my heart We wanna wish you a merry Christmas We wanna wish you a merry Christmas We wanna wish you a merry Christmas From the bottom of our heart He sees you when you're sleepin' He knows when you're awake He knows if you've been bad or good So be good for goodness sake You better watch out, you better not cry Better not pout, I'm telling you why Santa Claus is comin' to town Santa Claus is comin' to town Santa Claus is comin' to town Feliz navi dad Feliz navi dad Feliz navi dad Prospero anõ y felici dad We wanna wish you a merry Christmas We wanna wish you a merry Christmas We wanna wish you a merry Christmas From the bottom of my heart  "
