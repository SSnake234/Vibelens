Will heaven step in? Will it save us from our sin? Will it? 'Cause this house of mine stands strong That's the price you pay Leave behind your heartache, cast away Just another product of today Rather be the hunter than the prey And you're standing on the edge, face up 'cause you're a... Natural You gotta be so cold Yeah, you're a natural You gotta be so cold Will somebody Let me see the light within the dark trees' shadows and What's happenin'? Lookin' through the glass find the wrong within the past knowin' Oh, we are the youth Call out to the beast, not a word without the peace, facing A bit of the truth, the truth Deep inside me, I'm fading to black, I'm fading Took an oath by the blood of my hand, won't break it Gonna make it"
