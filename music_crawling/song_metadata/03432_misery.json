  "lyrics": "Intro: . So scared of breaking it But you won't let it bend And I wrote two hundred letters I will ever send Sometimes it cuts so much Deeper then they seem You'd rather cover up I'd rather let them be So let me be And I'll set you free I am in misery There ain't no body Who can comfort me (oh yeah) Why won't you answer me? Your silence is slowly killing me (oh yeah) Girl you really got me bad You really got me bad I'm gonna get you back Gonna get you back Your salty skin and how It mixes in with mine The way it feels to be Completely intertwined Not that I didn't care It's that I didn't know It's not what I didn't feel, It's what I didn't show So let me be And I'll set you free I am in misery There ain't no body Who can comfort me (oh yeah) Why won't you answer me? The silence is slowly killing me (oh yeah) Girl you really got me bad You really got me bad I'm gonna get you back Gonna get you back Say your faith is shaken You may be mistaken You keep me wide awake and Waiting for the sun I'm desperate and confused So far away from you I'm getting here Don't care where I have to go Why do you do what you do to me, yeah Why won't you answer me, answer me yeah Why do you do what you do to me yeah Why won't you answer me, answer me yeah I am in misery There ain't no other Who can comfort me Why won't you answer me? Your silence is slowly killing me (oh yeah) Girl you really got me bad You really got me bad I'm gonna get you back Gonna get you back"
