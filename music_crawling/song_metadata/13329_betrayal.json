  "lyrics": "My love has gone away quietly after a hundred days This is what's she has always said she won't stay,&nbsp;for more than what she can repay I can still hear her say that I'm not hearing tender play The day she let me kiss her was a display of love to those who she betray How can I put someone to the test when I thought I got the best Untill the taste of bitterness then I regret but still that I won't detest the love I can't forget like someone who has left. How can i leave someone for the rest when i'm alone facing the best Untill I take to try a reason I regret. But still that i won't detest who i can never forget like someone i once met"
