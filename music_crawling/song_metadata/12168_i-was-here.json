  "lyrics": "(This Is my first sh, it may not be 100% correct but I hope you like it! I wanna leave my footprints on the sands of time Know there was something that Meant something that I left behind When I leave this world, I'll leave no regrets Leave something to remember, So they won't forget I want to say I lived each day, Until I die  And know that I meant something in somebody's life The hearts I have touched, Will be the proof that I leave That I made a difference And this world will see I was here... I lived, I loved I was here...  I did, I've done, everything that I wanted  And it was more than I thought it would be  I will leave my mark so everyone will know I was here... I lived, I loved I was here...  I did, I've done, everything that I wanted  And it was more than I thought it would be  I will leave my mark so everyone will know  I was here... I just want them to know That I gave my all, Did my best Brought someone some happiness Left this world a little better just because...  I was here... I was here... I lived, I loved I was here...  I did, I've done, everything that I wanted  And it was more than I thought it would be  I will leave my mark so everyone will know  I was here..."
