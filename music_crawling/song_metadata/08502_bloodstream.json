  "lyrics": "| | | | | | | | | I've been spending out the time Couple women by my side I got sinning on my mind Sipping on red wine I've been sitting here for ages ripping out the pages How'd i get so faded? Oh no no don't leave me lonely now If you love me how do you never learn Oh colour crimson in my eyes One or two could free my mind now This is how it ends I feel the chemicals burning my bloodstream Fading out again I feel the chemicals burning my bloodstream So tell me when it kicks in | | | | | | I've been looking for a love Thought I'd find her in a bottle God make me another one Lord forgive me for the things I've done I was never meant to hurt no one I saw scars upon her broken heart Oh no no don't leave me lonely now If you love me how do you never learn Oh colour crimson in my eyes One or two could free my mind now This is how it ends I feel the chemicals burning my bloodstream Fading out again I feel the chemicals burning my bloodstream So tell me when it kicks in | | | | | | All the voices in my mind Calling out across the land Tell me when it kicks in And I saw scars upon her Tell me when it kicks in Broken-hearted"
