Take on me ( take on me) Take me on ( take on me) Ill be gone In a day or two...  So needless to say Im odds and ends, but ill be Stumbling away Slowly learning that life is ok Say after me Its no better to be safe than sorry Take on me ( take on me) Take me on ( take on me) Ill be gone In a day or two...     Oh, the things that you say Yeah, is it life or just to play My worries away? You're all the things i've got to remember You're shying away Ill be coming for you anyway Take on me ( take on me) Take me on ( take on me) I'll be gone In a day...  ( Take on me) Take on me ( Take me on) Take on me Ill be gone In a day... "
