  "lyrics": "They say don't let them in. Close your eyes and clear your thoughts again. When I'm all alone, they show up on their own. Cause inner demons fight their battles with fire. Inner demons don't play by the rules. They say just push them down, just fight them harder. Why would you give up on it so soon? So angels, angels please just keep on fighting. Angels don't give up on me today. The demons they are there; they keep on fighting. Cause inner demons just won't go away. So angels please, hear my prayer. Life is pain, life's not fair. So angels please; please stay here. Take the pain; take the fear. They say it won't be hard; they can't see the battles in my heart But when I turn away The demons seem to stay Cause inner demons don't play well with angels. They cheat and lie and steal and break and bruise. Angels please protect me from these rebels. This is a battle I don't want to lose. So angels, angels please just keep on fighting. Angels don't give up on me today. Cause the demons they are there, they keep on fighting. Cause Inner demons just won't go away. Angels, angels please keep on fighting. Angels don't give up on me today. Cause the demons, they are there. They keep on fighting. Inner demons just won't go away. So angels please, hear my prayer. Life is pain, life's not fair. So angels please, please stay here. Take the pain, take the fear."
