And suddenly you're not there I shouldn't cry, I shouldn't cry but I can't Seem to hold it in \"Oh please don't leave me\" When the fun is over it'll always seem to end the same Though I know it's coming, I can never seem to stop the pain In this very moment, you look even more amazing And I can't avoid your gaze Once again, I can see nothing but your face Time's ticking by, no matter how I try I'm struggling to keep up Night's taken hold as I'm walking home I wonder if I'll be okay alone Lights on the street glow at my feet my shadow is all I've got To keep me company Your silhouette is fading away too quickly for me to bear Just as the dark, it tears me apart. My surroundings blur once again I shouldn't cry, I shouldn't cry but I can't seem to hold it in \"Oh please don't leave me\" I shouldn't cry, I shouldn't cry but I can't seem to hold it in \"Oh please don't leave me\""
