  "lyrics": " Kiss me, goodbye, gone too soon I did give you my heart can't deny Hold on, let go, never sure Only can make believe all this time Coffee, cigarettes, not my style Pretty faces around but not right Don't cry, won't cry, I won't cry Be with you I just close my eyes So far away I can hardly make you mine So long the day you were always on my mind But in my dreams never try to hold you tight Don't want awake find you ain't here by my side"
