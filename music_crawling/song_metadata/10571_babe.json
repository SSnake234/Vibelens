  "lyrics": "What a shame Didn't wanna be the one that got away, yeah Big mis take, broke the sweetest promise That you never should have made I'm here on the kitchen floor. You call, but I won't hear it You said no one else, how could you do this, Babe?  You really blew this, babe  We ain't getting through this one, babe This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe This is the last time, this is the last time This is the last time, I'll ever call you babe What a waste Taking down the pictures and the plans we made, yeah  And it's strange how your face doesn't look so innocent Your secret has its consequence and that's on you, babe I break down every time you call. We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball You said no one else, how could you do this, Babe?  You really blew this, babe  We ain't getting through this one, babe This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe This is the last time, this is the last time This is the last time, I'll ever call you babe Since you admitted it, I keep picturing Her lips on your neck, I can't unsee it I hate that because of you, I can't love you Babe What a shame Didn't wanna be the one that got away how could you do this, Babe?  You really blew this, babe  We ain't getting through this one, babe This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe This is the last time, this is the last time This is the last time, I'll ever call you babe How could you do this, babe? I'm here on the kitchen floor, you call but I won't hear it You said I'm no one else, we ain't getting through this one, babe I break down every time you call, this is the last time We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball You said I'm no one else, this is the last time I'll never call you, babe"
