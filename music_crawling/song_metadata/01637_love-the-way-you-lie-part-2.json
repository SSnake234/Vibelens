Tone On the first page of our story the futu re seemed so bright then this thing turned out so evil, i dont know why i'm still sur prised even angels have their wicked schemes and you take that to new extremes but you'll always be my hero, Even though you lost your mind Just gonna stand there and watch me burn, buit thats al right because i like the way it hurts. Just gonna stand there and hear me cry, but thats al right because i love the way you lie....love the way you lie... ooh, love the way you lie!. Now there's gra vel in our voices, glasses shattered from the fight In this tug of war you'll always win, even, when i'm right Cause you feed me fables from your hands The violent words and empty threats, and its sick that all these battles are what keeps me satis fied. Oooh! So may be i'm a masochist, i try to run, but i wanna ever, wanna leave! Till the walls are going up in smoke with all our memories...."
