I'm falling more for you yeah yeah Mesmerized by anything you do yeah yeah Feeling my heart beat faster - All my mind can think of is you I can barely take it. Shimmie up It goes down down baby Down down baby Oh oh oh we go oh oh oh We going ko ko bop Shimmie shimmie ko ko bop, I think I like it Just slowly down down, let's not be shy now Doesn't matter what the world says to you Don't listen to their words If we stop time, we can stay beautiful and young Ah woo~ Oh this is the last night Ah woo~ It's all for us tonight Don't be nervous. It's just you and me yeah yeah Trust me and let's go Set your heart free yeah yeah Now's the time to set down everything that's bothering you Throw away your worries. Shakin' up It goes down down baby Down down baby Oh oh oh we go oh oh oh we going ko ko bop As the night deepens, all that shines is you Your eyes say everything, your heart's on your sleeve It's a beautiful night to be with you I know it okay, follow me this way Down down baby (It's goin' down) Down down baby (It's goin' down) Oh oh oh we go oh oh oh we going ko ko bop Down down baby (Down~) Just whisper in my ear Down down baby (It's goin' down) My heart's on fire here Oh oh oh let's go go oh oh oh we going ko ko bop"
