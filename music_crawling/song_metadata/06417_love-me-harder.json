I'll make it feel like the first time Cause if you want to keep me, you gotta gotta gotta love me harder And if you really need me, you gotta gotta gotta gotta love me harder Gotta love me harder Ooohhh Love me, love me, love me Ooohhh Harder, harder, harder Ooohhh Love me, love me, love me Ooohhh Harder, harder, harder So what do i do if I can't figure it out? You got to try, try, try again So what do i do if I can't figure it out? I'm gonna leave, leave, leave Cause if you want to keep me, you gotta gotta gotta love me harder And if you really need me, you gotta gotta gotta gotta love me harder Cause if you want to keep me, you gotta gotta gotta love me harder And if you really need me, you gotta gotta gotta gotta love me harder Gotta love me harder Ooohhh Love me, love me, love me Ooohhh Harder, harder, harder Ooohhh Love me, love me, love me Ooohhh Harder, harder, harder"
