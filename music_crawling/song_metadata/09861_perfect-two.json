  "lyrics": " You can be the peanut butter to my jelly, You can be the butterflies I feel in my belly You can be the captain and I can be a first maid You can be the chills that I feel on our first date. You can be the hero and I can be a sidekick You can be the tear that I cry if we ever split You can be the rain from the cloud when it's stormin' Or you could be the sun when it shines in the mornin' Don't know if I could ever be Without you coz boy you complete me And in time I know that we'll both see That we're all we need 'Cause you're the apple to my pie You're the straw to my berry You're the smoke to my high You're the one I wanna marry Coz you're the one for me (for me) And I'm the one for you (for you) You take the both of us (of us) And we're the perfect two We're the prefect two, We're the perfect two Baby me and you We're the perfect two. Don't know if I could ever be Without you coz boy you complete me And in time I know that we'll both see That we're all we need 'Cause you're the apple to my pie You're the straw to my berry You're the smoke to my high You're the one I wanna marry Coz you're the one for me (for me) And I'm the one for you (for you) You take the both of us (of us) And we're the perfect two We're the prefect two, We're the perfect two Baby me and you We're the perfect two. You know that I'll never doubt ya, And you know that I think about ya And you know I can't live without ya. I love the way that you smile, And maybe in just a while I can see me walk down the aisle 'Cause you're the apple to my pie You're the straw to my berry You're the smoke to my high You're the one I wanna marry Coz you're the one for me (for me) And I'm the one for you (for you) You take the both of us (of us) And we're the perfect two We're the prefect two, We're the perfect two Baby me and you We're the perfect two."
