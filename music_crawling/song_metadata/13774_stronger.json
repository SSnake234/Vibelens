Now it’s nothing but my way . My lonliness ain’t killing me no more I’m strong er . Than I ever thought that I could be, baby I used to go with the flow Didn’t really care ‘bout me You might think that I can’t take it, but you’re wrong Stronger than yesterday. Now it’s nothing but my way. My lonliness ain’t killing me no more I’m strong er . Here Here I go, on my own now I don’t need nobody, not any body He re I go  alright, here I go  Stronger than yesterday . Now it’s nothing but my way . My lon liness ain’t killing me no more I’m . Stronger than yesterday . Now it’s nothing but my way. My lonli ness ain’t killing me no more I’m . Stronger than yester day Now it’s nothing but my way My lon liness ain’t killing me no more I’m strong er ."
