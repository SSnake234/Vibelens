Then afterwards we drop into a quiet little place And have a drink or two. And then I go and spoil it all By saying something stupid Like I love you. I can see it in your eyes You heard the night before And though it's just a line to you And never seemed so right before I practice every day to find some clever Lines to say To make the meaning come true. But then I think I'll wait until the evening Gets late And I'm alone with you. The time is right And oh the night's so blue. And then I go and spoil it all By saying something stupid Like I love you. I [G] [G] lo lo ve you [Eb ] x5    "
