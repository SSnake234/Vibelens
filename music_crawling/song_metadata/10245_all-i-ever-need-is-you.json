  "lyrics": "Sometimes when I'm down and all alone. Just like a child without a home. The love you give me keeps me hangin' on, honey, all I ever need is  you. You're my first love, you're my last. You're my future, you're my past. And loving you is all I ask, honey, all I ever need is you. Winters come and they go. And we watch the melting snow. But sure as summer follows spring, All the things you do, give me, a reason to built my world around you. Some men follow rainbows, I am told. Some men search for silver, some for gold. I have found my treasure in your soul, honey, All I ever need is you. Without our love, I'd never find the way. Through ups and downs of every single day. I won't sleep at night until you say, my honey, all I ever need is  you."
