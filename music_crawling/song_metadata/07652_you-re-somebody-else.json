  "lyrics": " I saw the part of you That only when you're older you will s ee too You will see too I held the better cards But every stroke of luck has got a bleed through It's got a bleed through You held the balance of the time That only blindly I could read you But I could read you It's like you told me Go forward slowly It's not a race to the end Well you look like yourself But you're somebody else Only it ain't on the surface Well you talk like yourself No, I hear someone else though Now you're making me nervous You were the better part Of every bit of beating heart that I had Whatever I had I finally sat alone Pitch black flesh and bone Couldn't believe that you were gone Well you look like yourself But you're somebody else Only it ain't on the surface Well you talk like yourself No, I hear someone else though Now you're making me nervous Well you look like yourself But you're somebody else Only it ain't on the surface Well you talk like yourself No, I hear someone else though Now you're making me nervous Well you look like yourself But you're somebody else Only it ain't on the surface Well you talk like yourself No, I hear someone else though Now you're making me nervous Well you look like yourself But you're somebody else Only it ain't on the surface Well you talk like yourself No, I hear someone else though Now you're making me nervous I saw the part of you that only when you're older You will see too, you will see too"
