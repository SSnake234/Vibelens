  "lyrics": "All alone I have started my journey&nbsp; to the darkness of darkness I go With a reason, I stopped for a moment&nbsp; in this world full of pleasure so frail Town after town on I travel,&nbsp; pass through faces I know and know not Like a bird in flight, sometimes I topple. Time and time again, just farewells Donde voy, donde voy.&nbsp; Day by day, my story unfolds Solo estoy, solo estoy.&nbsp; All alone as the day I was born"
