Everything I need is on the ground Nah but they don’t hear me though. ( Yeah what goes up it must come down) Nah but they don’t hear me though. ( You’re running out of time) My world’s been hectic seems e lectric But I’ve been waking up with your voice in my head And I’m trying to send a message And let you know that every single minute I’m without you I regret it Every day every night I’ve been thinking back on you and I Every day every night ...I worked my whole life Just to get right just to be like Look at me I’m never coming down I worked my whole life Just to get high just to realize Everything I need is on the everything I need is on the ground On the ground. Everything I need is on the ground Nah but they don’t hear me though. ( Yeah what goes up it must come down) Nah but they don’t hear me though. ( You’re running out of time) ...I’m way up in the clouds And they say I’ve made it now but I figured it out Everything I need is on the ground Just drove by your house so far from you now but I figured it out Everything I need is on the Everything I need is on the ground On the ground. Everything I need is on the ground Nah but they don’t hear me though. ( Yeah what goes up it must come down) Nah but they don’t hear me though. ( You’re running out of time)"
