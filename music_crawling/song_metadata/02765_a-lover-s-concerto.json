  "lyrics": " How gentle is the rain that falls softly on the meadow Birds high up in the trees serenade the clouds with their melodies Oh, see there beyond the hill, the bright colours of the rainbow Some magic from above made this day for us just to fall in love. Now I belong to you from this day until forever, Just love me tender- ly and I'll give to you every part of me. Oh, don't ever make me cry through long lonely nights without love. Be always true to me, keep this day in your heart eternal- ly. Some day we shall re- turn to this place upon the meadow. We'll walk out in the rain, see the birds above singing once again. Oh, you hold me in your arms, and say once again you love me, And if your love is true, everything will be just as wonder- ful. You hold me in your arms, and say once again you love me, And if your love is true, everything will be just as wonder- ful."
