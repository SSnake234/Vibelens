  "lyrics": "Send it to my phone, send it to my phone You already know I keep it on the low Baby, you can trust , me promise I'm alone I won't tell a soul, send it to my phone. Send it to my phone, send it to my phone You already know ,I keep it on the low Baby, you can trust ,me promise I'm alone I won't tell a soul, send it to my phone. You took it in the mirror, so I could see it clear Baby have no fear, you know it's stayin' here I know you wanna share, baby might as well You know I keep it trill, you know I'd never tell. I'm sure you took a few, time you wanted to I know when that hotline bling, that can only mean one thing You know what I like, what I've been waitin' on What's takin' so long? Send it to my phone. Send it to my phone, send it to my phone You already know I keep it on the low Baby, you can trust. me promise I'm alone I won't tell a soul, send it to my phone. Send it to my phone"
