  "lyrics": "  Come with me Stay the night What do ya expect me to say (You know it's just too little too late) You take my hand And you say you've changed But boy you know your begging don't fool me Because to you it's just a game (You know it's just too little too late) So let me on down Cause time has made me strong I'm starting to move on I'm gonna say this now Your chance has come and gone It's just too little too late a little too wrong And I can't wait But you know all the right things to say (You know it's just too little too late) You say you dream of my face But you don't like me You just like the chase To be real It doesn't matter anyway (You know it's just too little too late) Yeah yeaaahhh... It's just too little too late ... Mhmmm Yeah yeaaahhh... It's just too little too late ... Mhmmm I was young And in love I gave you everything, but it wasn't enough And now you wanna communicate (You know it's just too little too late) Go find someone else In letting you go I'm loving myself You got a problem But don't come asking me for help It's just too little too late a little too wrong And I can't wait But you know all the right things to say (You know it's just too little too late) You say you dream of my face But you don't like me You just like the chase To be real It doesn't matter anyway (You know it's just too little too late) I can love with all of my heart, baby I know I have so much to give (I have so much to give) With a player like you I don't have a prayer That's no way to live  It's just too little too late a little too wrong And I can't wait But you know all the right things to say (You know it's just too little too late) You say you dream of my face But you don't like me You just like the chase To be real It doesn't matter anyway (You know it's just too little too late)  FADING.....  .......... It's just too little too late a little too wrong And I can't wait But you know all the right things to say (You know it's just too little too late) You say you dream of my face But you don't like me You just like the chase To be real It doesn't matter anyway (You know it's just too little too late)"
