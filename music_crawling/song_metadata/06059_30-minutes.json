  "lyrics": "- - - (4x) Out of sight Out of time Do we run? For the rest Of my life Can we fly? We could lose In the moment To make plans Or mistakes 30 minutes, a blink of an eye 30 minutes, to alter our lives 30 minutes, to make up my mind 30 minutes, to finally decide 30 minutes, to whisper your name 30 minutes, to shoulder the blame 30 minutes, of bliss, thirty lies 30 minutes, to finally decide Carousels That we shape Under shade Casting shade Crying rain Can we fly? We could lose Either way Chances fail Trains derail 30 minutes, a blink of an eye 30 minutes, to alter our lives 30 minutes, to make up my mind 30 minutes, to finally decide 30 minutes, to whisper your name 30 minutes, to shoulder the blame 30 minutes, of bliss, thirty lies 30 minutes, to finally decide To decide To decide, to decide, to decide To decide To decide, to decide, to decide"
