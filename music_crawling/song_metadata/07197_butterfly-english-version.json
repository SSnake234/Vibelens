I think maybe this is all a lie A- yoo...please don’t you disappear. Is it true? Is it true? You, you I’m scared because you’re beautiful Un- true, un- true You, you, you Can you please stay here? Can you promise me one thing? If I touch you, will you fly. up to the sky? I’m scared, I’m scared, so scared. Can you please stop time? How about rewind? Would you for- get everything, that we had? I’m scared, I’m scared, so scared. Butterfly, like a butterfly Like a butterfly, you’re beautiful in the sky. Butterfly, like a buttetfly Like a butterfly, you’re not meant to be mine."
