When I'm done here So if you're asking me I want you to know When my time comes Forget the one that I've done Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed And don't re sent me And when you're feeling empty Keep me in your memory Leave out all the rest Leave out all the rest Don't be afraid I've taken my beating I've shed when I'm made I'm struggling to surface Not all the way through I've never been perfect But neither have you So if you're asking me I want you to know When my time comes Forget the one that I've done Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed Don't re sent me And when you're feeling empty Keep me in your memory Leave out all the rest Leave out all the rest Forgetting all the hurt inside You've learned to have so well Pretending someone else can come and save me From my self I can't be who you are When my time comes Forget the one that I've done Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed Don't re sent me And when you're feeling empty Keep me in your memory Leave out all the rest Leave out all the rest"
