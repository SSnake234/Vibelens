And just as the news of the world started to be gin, I saw my darling and my best friend walking in. Al though I was sitting right there they didn'n see me. And so they both sat right down in the front of me. And when he kissed her lips then I almost died. And in the middle of the colour cartoon I started to cry. Oh Sad movies always make me cry Oh oh oh Sad movies always make me cry Oh oh oh Sad movies always make me cry Oh oh oh Sad movies always make me cry And so I got on up and slowly I walked on home, And Mama saw the tears and said \"Baby what is wrong\". And so just to keep from telling her a lie, I just said \"Sad movies makes me cry\". Oh Sad movies always make me cry Oh oh oh Sad movies always make me cry Oh oh oh Sad movies always make me cry Oh oh oh Sad movies always make me cry"
