  "lyrics": "Hợp âm:  She just wants to be Beautiful she goes Unnoticed, she knows No limits she craves Attention, she praises She prays to be Sculpted by the sculptor Oh, she don't see The light that's shining Deeper than the eyes can find it Maybe we have made her blind So she tries to cover up her pain And cut her woes away 'Cause covergirls don't cry But there's a hope That's waiting for you in the dark You should know you're beautiful Just the way you are And you don't have to change a thing The world could change its heart No scars to your beautiful, We're stars and we're beautiful Oh oh oh  oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh  oh oh oh oh And you don't have to change a thing The world could change its heart No scars to your beautiful, We're stars and we're beautiful She has dreams to be An envy, so she's covergirls eat nothing she says \"Beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything\" \"What's a little bit of hunger?\" She fades away She don't see her perfect, She don't understand she's worth it Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface Oh Oh Oh oh So to all the girls that's hurting Let me be your mirror, Help you see a little bit clearer There's a hope That's waiting for you in the dark You should know you're beautiful Just the way you are And you don't have to change a thing The world could change its heart No scars to your beautiful, We're stars and we're beautiful Oh oh oh  oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh  oh oh oh oh And you don't have to change a thing The world could change its heart No scars to your beautiful, We're stars and we're beautiful There's a hope That's waiting for you in the dark You should know you're beautiful Just the way you are And you don't have to change a thing The world could change its heart No scars to your beautiful, We're stars and we're beautiful Oh oh oh  oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh  oh oh oh oh And you don't have to change a thing The world could change its heart No scars to your beautiful, We're stars and we're beautiful"
