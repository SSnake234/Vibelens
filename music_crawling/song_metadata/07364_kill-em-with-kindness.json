And kill 'em with kindness, kill 'em with kindness. Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness. Kill 'em with kindness , Kill 'em with kindness , go ahead, go ahead, go ahead now.    We're running out of time chasing our lies. Every day a small piece of you dies. Always somebody you're willing to fight, to be right. Your lies are bullets, your mouth's a gun and no war in anger was ever won. Put out the fire before igniting, next time you're fighting. And kill 'em with kindness, kill 'em with kindness. Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness. Kill 'em with kindness , Kill 'em with kindness , go ahead, go ahead, go ahead now.    Go ahead, go ahead now.  Go ahead, go ahead now. Your lies are bullets, your mouth's a gun and no war in anger was ever won. Put out the fire before igniting, next time you're fighting. And kill 'em with kindness, kill 'em with kindness. Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness. Kill 'em with kindness , Kill 'em with kindness , go ahead, go ahead, go ahead now.  Go ahead, go ahead now.  Go ahead, go ahead now.  Go ahead, go ahead now."
