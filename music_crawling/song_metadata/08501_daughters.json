  "lyrics": "  i know a girl she puts the color inside of my world she's just like a maze where all of the walls all continually change I've done all i can to stand on the steps with my heart in my hands Now i started to see maybe its got nothing to do with me. so fathers be good to your daughters, daughters will love like you do, girls become lovers who turn into mothers so mothers be good to your daughters too.   Oh you see that skin its the same shes been standing in since the day she say him walkin away now she’s left cleaning up the mess he made so fathers be good to your daughters, daughters will love like you do, girls become lovers who turn into mothers so mothers be good to your daughters too. boys you can break find out how much they can take boys will be strong and boys soldier on but boys would be gone without warmth of a woman's good good heart  x2     so mothers be good to your daughters too. so mothers be good to your daughters too"
