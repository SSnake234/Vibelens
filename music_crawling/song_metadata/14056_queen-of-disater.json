Ya got me spinning like a ballerina, Feeling gangsta every time I see ya You're the king and baby I'm the queen of disaster, disaster Got me spinning like a ballerina, You're the bad boy that I always dreamed of You're the king and baby, I'm the queen of disaster, disaster  My mascara thick, I get emotional You know I was more than just a party girl, Isn't hard to see what's going on, I'm so far gone When I saw your face it was incredible Pin it on my soul it was indelible Let's celebrate our twisted fate, we're the broken ones Ya got me spinning like a ballerina, Feeling gangsta every time I see ya You're the king and baby I'm the queen of disaster, disaster Got me spinning like a ballerina, You're the bad boy that I always dreamed of You're the king and baby, I'm the queen of disaster, disaster  Ladies and gentlemen, for the very first time.... Ya got me spinning like a ballerina, Feeling gangsta every time I see ya You're the king and baby I'm the queen of disaster, disaster Got me spinning like a ballerina, You're the bad boy that I always dreamed of You're the king and baby, I'm the queen of disaster, disaster  "
