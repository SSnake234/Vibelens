  "lyrics": "  I'm not the type to get my heart broken I'm not the type to get upset and cry 'cause I never leave my heart open Relationships don't get deep to me Never got the whole in love thing And someone can say they love me truly But at the time it didn't mean a thing My mind is gone, I'm spinning round And deep inside, my tears I'll drown I'm losing grip, what's happening I stray from love, this is how I feel Felt like, I was just a victim And it cut me like a knife When you walked out of my life Now I'm, in this condition And I've, got all the symptoms Of a girl with a broken heart But no matter what you'll never see me cry How did I get here with you, I'll never know? I never meant to let it get so, personal. After all I tried to do, stay away from loving you I'm broken hearted, I can't let you know And I won't let it show You won't see me cry All my life..."
