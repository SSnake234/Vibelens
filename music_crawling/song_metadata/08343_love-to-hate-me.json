I'ma kick back Only thing I think about is big stacks ( Racks, racks) Negative days, negative nights Baby, you're wasting all your time I can't relate, I keep it light No, no, no drama in my life (Uh) Wake up, yeah, make up, maybe I need you? Nah, I been good lately Blowin' up, workin' busy You ain't worth my love if you only love to hate me Love, l-l- love, l-l- love how you love to hate me Love, l-l- love, l-l-love, you ain't worth my love if you only love to hate me I'ma let you fade into the background Baby, all my shows are gettin' too loud Keep on turnin' it up when you want me down Negative days, negative nights Baby, you're wasting all your time I can't relate, I keep it light No, no, no drama in my life (Uh) Wake up, yeah, make up, maybe I need you? Nah, I been good lately Blowin' up, workin' busy You ain't worth my love if you only love to hate me Love, l-l- love, l-l- love how you love to hate me Love, l-l- love, l-l-love, you ain't worth my love if you only love to hate me Love to hate me, you hate to love me I'm takin' back what you've taken from me You're mistaken, honey, this something that Remind me why I be a lone on my own If I needed you, I'd have you that I know, hold up I could do bad by myself, don't need help One of a kind, the hand that I was dealt, like oh, well Felt Cupid was stupid, I should have knew it 'Cause I been through it, you wouldn't do it If it ain't foolish, stupid Love, l-l- love, l-l- love how you love to hate me Love, l-l- love, l-l- love, you ain't worth my love if you only love to hate me Love, l-l- love, l-l- love how you love to hate me Love, l-l- love, l-l- love, you ain't worth my love if you only love to hate me"
