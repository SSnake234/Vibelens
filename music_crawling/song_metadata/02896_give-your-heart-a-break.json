Don’t wanna break your heart wanna give your heart a break I know you’re scared as wrong that you might make a mistake There’s just one life to live to wait to waste So let me give your heart a break Cause you've been hurt before I see it in your eyes You try to smile it away Don’t wanna break your heart the ache the ache So let me give your heart a break Your heart a break heart a break Your heart a break This is so much you can take give your heart a break heart a break Your heart a break  The day you I told me first met you you’ll never fall in love"
