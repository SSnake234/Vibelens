  "lyrics": "There comes a time when we heed a certain call When the world must come together as one There are people dying Oh, and it's time to lend a hand to life The greatest gift of all We can't go on pretending day by day That someone, somewhere will soon make a change We're all a part of God's great big family And And the truth You know love is all we need We are the world, we are the children We are the ones who make a brighter day so let's start giving There's a choice we're making we're saving our own lives It's true we'll make a better day just you and me Well, send them you your heart so they know that someone cares And their lives will be stronger and free As God has shown us by turning stone to bread And so we all must lend a helping hand We are the world, we are the children We are the ones who make a brighter day so let's start giving There's a choice we're making we're saving our own lives It's true we'll make a better day just you and me When you're down and out there seems no hope at all But if you just believe there's no way we can fall Well, well, well, let's realize that a change can only come When we stand together as one We are the world, we are the children We are the ones who make a brighter day so let's start giving There's a choice we're making we're saving our own lives It's true we'll make a better day just you and me"
