We will never take up too much time or attention Take a second just to make our connection I would do anything for you' re affection Kinda fun tryna to go about it all the wrong ways. I'm just showing to you I wanna let it all out You're so perfectly fine I could talk all day but let me spell it out... (ABCDEFGH) I love you still And you know I always will Till the end of time I won't change my mind Love you I'll be there I will never disappear Said forever I swear So I'll be there..."
