  "lyrics": "Lily was a little girl Afraid of the big, wide world She grew up within her castle walls Now and then she tried to run And then on the night with the setting sun She went in the woods away So afraid, all alone They warned her, don't go there There's creatures who are hiding in the dark Then something came creeping It told her Don't you worry just follow everywhere I go Top over the mountains of valley low Give you every thing you've been dreaming of Just let me in, ooh Everything you wanted gonna be the magic story you've been told And you'll be safe under my control Just let me in, ooh   Just let me in, ooh She knew she was hypnotized And walking on cold thin ice Then it broke, and she awoke again Then she ran faster than Start screaming, is there someone out there? Please help me Come get me Behind her, she can hear it say Follow everywhere I go Top over the mountains of valley low Give you every thing you've been dreaming of Just let me in, ooh Everything you wanted gonna be the magic story you've been told And you'll be safe under my control Just let me in, ooh   Just let me in, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Everything you wanted gonna be the magic story you've been told And you'll be safe under my control Just let me in, ooh Follow everywhere I go Top over the mountains of valley low Give you every thing you've been dreaming of Just let me in, ooh Then she ran faster than Start screaming, is there someone out there? Please help me Just let me in, ooh"
