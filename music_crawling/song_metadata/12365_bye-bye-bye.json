It ain't no lie ...I want to see you out that door. Baby bye bye bye Bye bye Don't want to be a fool for you Just another player in your game for two ...You may hate me but it ain't no lie. Baby bye bye bye Bye bye. Don't want to make it tough I just want to tell you that I've had enough ..It might sound crazy but it ain't no lie You just hit me with the truth Now girl you're more than welcome to So give me one good reason Baby come on That life would be much bet ter once you're gone ...I know that I can't take no more. It ain't no lie ...I want to see you out that door. Baby bye bye bye Bye bye Don't want to be a fool for you Just another player in your game for two ...You may hate me but it ain't no lie. Baby bye bye bye Bye bye. Don't want to make it tough I just want to tell you that I've had enough ..It might sound crazy but it ain't no lie I'm givng up I know for sure ...Don't want to be your fool in this game for two So I'm leaving you be hind (Bye bye bye)I don't want to make it tough (Make it tough) But I've had enough (Bye bye) And it ain't no lie Bye bye Don't want to be a fool for you Just another player in your game for two ...You may hate me but it ain't no lie. Baby bye bye bye Bye bye. Don't want to make it tough I just want to tell you that I've had enough ..It might sound crazy but it ain't no lie"
