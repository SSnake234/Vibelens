And I wake to find that you're not there What do I do to make you want me? What I gotta do to be heard? What do I say when it's all over? Sorry seems to be the hardest word It's sad, so sad It's a sad sad situation And it's  getting more and more absurd It's sad, so sad Why can' we talk it over Oh it seems to me That sorry seems to be the hardest word What do I do to make you want me? What I gotta do to be heard? What do I say when it's all over? Sorry seems to be the hardest word What do I do to make you love me? What I gotta do to be heard? What do I do when lightning strikes me What have I got to do? What have I got to do?    sorry seems to be the hardest word Outro: , , ,  , , ,"
