  "lyrics": " Step one you say we need to talk He walks you say sit down it’s just a talk He smiles politely back at you You stare politely right on through Some sort of indow to your right As he goes left and you stay right Between the lines of fear and blame And you begin to wonder why you came Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life"
