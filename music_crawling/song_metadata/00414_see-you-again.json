Everything I went through you were standing there by my side And now you gonna be with me for the last ride It's been a long day without you my friend And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again We've come a long way from where we began Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again When I see you again  Verse   2 Small turn to a friendship a friendship Turn into a bond and that bond will never Be broke and the love will never get lost When that line had to be drawn and that line is what We reach so remember me when I'm gone How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got? Everything I went through you were standing there by my side And now you gonna be with me for the last ride So let the light guide your way Hold every memory as you go And every road you take Will always lead you home It's been a long day without you my friend And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again We've come a long way from where we began Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again When I see you again"
