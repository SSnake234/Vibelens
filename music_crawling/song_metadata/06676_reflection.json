  "lyrics": "Look at me You may think you see Who I really am But you'll never know me Every day It's as if I play a part Now I see If I wear a mask I can fool the world But I cannot fool my heart Who is that girl I see Staring straight back at me When will my re- flection show Who I am in- side I am now In a world where I Have to hide my heart And what I be- lieve in But somehow I will show the world What's inside my heart And be loved for who I am Who is that girl I see Staring straight back at me When will my re- flection show Someone I don't know Must I pre- tend that I'm Someone else for all time When will my re- flection show Who I am in- side There's a heart that must be free to fly That burns with a need to know the reason why Why must we all conceal What we think how we feel Must there be a secret me I'm forced to hide I won't pre- tend that I'm Someone else for all time When will my re- flection show Who I am in- side"
