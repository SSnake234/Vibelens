  "lyrics": "I sit and wait does an angel contemplate my fate  and do they know when we're grey and old 'cos I've been told that salvation lets their wings unfold so when I’m lying in my bed thoughts running through my head and I feel that love is dead I’m loving angels instead and through it all she offers me protection a lot of love and affection whether I’m right or wrong and down the waterfall wherever it may take me I know that life wont break me when I come to call she wont forsake me I’m loving angels instead when I’m feeling weak and my pain walks down a one way street I look above and I know ill always be blessed with love and as the feeling grows she breathes flesh to my bones and when love is dead I’m loving angels instead and through it all she offers me protection a lot of love and affection whether I’m right or wrong and down the waterfall wherever it may take me I know that life wont break me when I come to call she wont forsake me I’m loving angels instead  x4 and through it all she offers me protection a lot of love and affection whether I’m right or wrong and down the waterfall wherever it may take me I know that life wont break me when I come to call she wont forsake me I’m loving angels instead"
