  "lyrics": "I’ve seen the youth, I’ve seen truth, I’ve seen a booth, with a red roof. I’ve seen lies, I’ve seen flies, I’ve seen lies, In the eyes of flies. But you are a beautiful flower, you bloom every hour, ooooooooooo. So precious and revealing, like a rabbit, stuck to the ceiling. So beautiful and random, like a weasel and a duck on a tandem. oooooooooo!"
