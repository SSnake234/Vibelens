When I want you in my arms When I want you and all your charms When ever I want you all I have to do is Drea-ea-ea-ea eam, dream dream dream 2. When I feel blue in the night And I need you to hold me tight When ever I want you all I have to do is Drea-ea-ea-ea eam, Drea-ea-ea-ea eam I can make you mine, taste your lips of wine Anytime night or day Only trouble is , gee whiz. I’m dreamin’ my life a- way 3. I need you so that I could die I love you so and that is why When ever I want you all I have to do is Drea-ea-ea-ea eam, dream dream dream Drea-ea-ea-ea eam, Drea-ea-ea-ea eam I can make you mine, taste your lips of wine Anytime night or day Only trouble is , gee whiz. I’m dreamin’ my life a- way 3. I need you so that I could die I love you so and that is why When ever I want you all I have to do is Drea-ea-ea-ea eam, dream dream dream Drea-ea-ea-ea eam, dream dream dream Drea-ea-ea-ea eam, dream dream dream"
