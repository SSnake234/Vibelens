Since you were an angel from the sky, you fill my fanta- sy The way you look takes me so high, you're everything to me And all I want is your photograph, how I'm longing for your smile So come and touch me, come and feel me, hear me cry. Chorus:You're my love (you're my love) You're my life (you're my life) Every day (everyday) Every night (every night) Is it right (is it right) What I feel (what I feel) How I wish you were for real. You're my love (you're my love) you're my life (you're my life) Every day (everyday) every night (every night) In my dreams (in my dreams) I'm with you (I'm with you) Will you make my dreams come true? 2. I'm all alone the night has come, you're in my radi- o It's when you sing I feel the sun, now i can feel the show Since for- evermore you're my destiny, take my loneliness a- way So come and touch me, come and feel me, hear me say * Since for- evermore you're my destiny, take my loneliness a- way So come and touch me, come and feel me, hear me say"
