Pushing each other to the l imits, By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure Once I was eleven years ol d, my daddy told me, go get yourself a wife or you’ll be lonely. Once I was eleven years o ld I always have that dre am like my Daddy before me So I´m started writing songs Something about the g lory, just always seemed to bore me, Cause only those I really love Once I was twenty years ol d, my story got t old, before the morning sun, when life was lonely. Once I was twenty years ol d I only seek my goals, I don’t be lieve in failure. Cause I know the smallest voices, I got my boys with me at least t hose in favour and if we don´t see before I leave, Once I was 20 years ol d my story got t old I was writing about ever ything, Once I was 20 years ol d Soon we´ll be 30 years ol d our songs have been so ld we´re travel around the world Soon we´ll be 30 years ol d I´m still learning about li fe so I can sing them all my songs and I can t ell them storys Most of my boys are with me some are still out seeking glo ry my brother I´ m still sorry Soon I´ll be 60 years ol d my daddy got sixty- one remember life and then your life I make the man so hap py I hope my children come and visit Soon I´ll be 60 years ol d when I have a lot of children who can bore me Soon I´ll be 60 years ol d Soon I´ll be 60 years o ld when I have a lot of children who can warm Soon I´ll be 60 years ol d Once I was seven years ol d, my momma told me, go make yourself some friends or you’ll be lonely once I was seven years o ld once I was seven years ol d"
