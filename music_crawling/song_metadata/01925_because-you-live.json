  "lyrics": "Staring out at the rain with a heavy heart It's the end of the world in my mind Then your voice pulls me back like a wake up call I've been looking for the answer Some where I couldn't see that it was right there But now I know what I didn't know Because you live and breathe Because you make me believe in myself when nobody else can help Because you live, girl Because you live, I live Because you live there's a reason why I carry on when I lose the fight I want to give what you've given me always"
