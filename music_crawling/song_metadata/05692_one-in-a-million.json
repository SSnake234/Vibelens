I could be in love But I just don't know (don't know, girl) Baby one thing is for certain Whatever you do is working Other girls don't matter In your presence can't do what you do There's a million girls around but I don't see no one but you Girl you're so one in a million You are Baby you're the best I ever had Best I ever had And I'm certain that There ain't nothing better No there ain't nothing better than this There's a million girls around but I don't see no one but you Ooh all that I can think about is what this thing could be Baby you're one of a kind That means that you're the only one for me"
