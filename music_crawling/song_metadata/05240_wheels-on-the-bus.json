The wipers on the bus go:\"Swish, swish, swish\" Swish, swish, swish Swish, swish, swish The wipers on the bus go:\"Swish, swish, swish\" All through the town. The doors on the bus go open and shut Open and shut Open and shut The doors on the bus go open and shut All through the town. The horn on the bus goes:\"Beep, beep, beep\" Beep, beep, beep Beep, beep, beep The horn on the bus goes:\"Beep, beep, beep\" All through the town. The gas on the bus goes:\"Glug, glug, glug” Glug, glug, glug Glug, glug, glug The gas on the bus goes:\"Glug, glug, glug\" All through the town. The money on the bus goes:\"Clink, clink, clink” Clink, clink, clink Clink, clink, clink The money on the bus goes:\"Clink, clink, clink\" All through the town. The babies on the bus says:\"Wah, wah, wah” Wah, wah, wah Wah, wah, wah The babies on the bus says:\"Wah, wah, wah\" All through the town. The people on the bus says:\"Shush, shush, shush” Shush, shush, shush Shush, shush, shush The people on the bus says:\"Shush, shush, shush\" All through the town. The mummy on the bus says:”I love you” I love you I love you The daddy on the bus says:”I love you, too” All through the town."
