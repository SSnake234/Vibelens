  "lyrics": "Intro:     First time when I saw you it was paradise Cause you had only eyes for me I dont see me in your eyes no more What happened to a dream I can only give my heart now And try to give it to you Oh help me, come make my dreams come true Let me take you to the clouds above Cause I'll never find a better one Every body needs so one my heart? Cause youre the first and youre the last Let me take you to the clouds a bove And if my love is not e nough You will never find someone like me Cause youre the first, my destiny Were daytime friends, and nighttime lovers Why you are so crude tonight The first heart, the deepest in my heart And I know my love is right, baby I can only give my heart now And try to give it to you Baby love me, come make my dreams come true Let me take you to the clouds above Cause I'll never find a better one Every body needs so one my heart? Cause youre the first and youre the last Let me take you to the clouds a bove And if my love is not e nough You will never find someone like me Cause youre the first, my destiny"
