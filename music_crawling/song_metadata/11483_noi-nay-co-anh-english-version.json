(x2) You're the one that comes to my life so beautifully You're the one looking like the warm sunshine in the morning Your happy smile, i lose my heart to you You drive me so crazy, i fall in love with you You came like the dawn waking me up after long nights You’ve filled my life with love flying up to the sky Your lovely eyes make me go crazy wanna kiss your lips and your hair, baby Hold my hands, i'm your man i will stand by you if i can The wind in the sky Falling stars are holding you lightly Hold my hands, i'm your man I will stand by you if i can Close your eyes my dear You come over here Crazy love without fear Here comes gently the spring, brin ging dreams to me The summer rainy days are really sweet Autumn leaves are falling, i can’t stop missing you My little love belongs to only you. Strolling:  ....  (x2) I hear, your tender voice, whisper ing in my ears Love in my eyes, I can’t hide it, oh my dear You're a troublemaker, my heart said i’m a loser It’s stronger, crazier Loving, deep in the sea Looking, sweet as the leaves Don’t escape from me, my baby And why don’t you look at me? Your face is so lovely Your smile is for only me My heart's telling you. Hold my hands, i'm your man i will stand by you if i can The wind in the sky Falling stars are holding you lightly Hold my hands, i'm your man I will stand by you if i can Close your eyes my dear You come over here Crazy love without fear Here comes gently the spring, brin ging dreams to me The summer rainy days are really sweet Autumn leaves are falling, i can’t stop missing you My little love belongs to only you."
