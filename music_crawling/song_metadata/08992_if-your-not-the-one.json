  "lyrics": "If you’re not the one then why does my soul feel glad, today? If you’re not the one then why does my hand fit yours, this way? If you are not mine then why does your heart return, my call? If you were not mine would I have the strength to stand, at all? I never know what the future brings, But I know your here with me now, We’ll make it through and I hope you are the one I share my life with, I don’t wanna run away, but I can’t take it, I don’t understand If I’m not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am? Is there any way that I can stay in your eyes? If I don’t need you then why am I crying on my bed? If I don’t need you then why does your name resound in my head? If you’re not for me then why does this distance maim my life, If your not for me then why do I dream of you, as my wife? I don’t know why you’re so far away, But I know that this much is true, We’ll make it through and I hope you are the one I share my life with, And I wish that you could be the one I die with, And I pray that you’re the one I build my home with, I hope I love you all my life. I don’t wanna run away, but I can’t take it, I don’t understand If I’m not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am? Is there any way that I can stay in your eyes? Cos I miss you body and soul, so strong that it takes my breath away, And I breathe you into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today, Cos I love you, whether its wrong or right, And though I can’t be with you tonight, you know my heart is by your side. I don’t wanna run away, but I can’t take it, I don’t understand If I’m not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am? Is there any way that I can stay in your eyes?"
