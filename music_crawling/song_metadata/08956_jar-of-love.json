  "lyrics": "Tone Another sun rise, another sun set soon, it'll all be yester day Another good day, another bad day what did you do to day? Why do we choose to chase what we'll lose? What you want isn't what you have What you have may not be yours to keep If I could find love At a stop, in a park with open arms I would save all my love in a jar, made of sparks, sealed in my beating heart Could it be yours to keep the Jar of Love Another left turn, another head turns Could he be someone I de serve? Another right turn, another lesson learned Never leave an open flame to burn Why do we choose to chase what we'll lose? What you want isn't what you have What you have may not be yours to keep If I could find love At a stop, in a park with open arms I would save all my love in a jar, made of sparks, sealed in my beating heart Could it be yours to keep the Jar of Love Could you be my love Could you be my love Could you be my love Could you be my love Could you be my love Could you be his love Could you be my love Could I be your love? If I could find love At a stop, in a park with open arms I would save all my love in a jar, made of sparks, sealed in my beating heart Could it be yours to keep the Jar of Love If I could find love At a stop, in a park with open arms I would save all my love in a jar, made of sparks, sealed in my beating heart Could it be yours to keep the Jar of Love If I could find love At a stop, in a park with open arms I would save all my love in a jar, made of sparks, sealed in my beating heart Could it be yours to keep the Jar of Love Could it be yours to keep the Jar of Love Could it be yours to keep the Jar of Love"
