  "lyrics": "Midnight Not a sound from the pavement Has the moon lost her memory She is smiling alone In the lamplight The withered leaves collect at my feet And the wind Begins to moan Memory All alone in the moonlight I can dream of the old days) Life was beautiful then I remember the time I knew what happiness was Let the memory live again Every street lamp seems to beat a fata listic warning and the street lamp gutters And soon it will be morning Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters And soon it will be morning Daylight I must wait for the sunrise I must think of a new life And I mustnt give in When the dawn comes Tonight will be a memory too And a new day will begin  Burnt out ends of smoky days The still cold smell of morning A street lamp dies, another night is over Another day is dawning Touch me, It' s so easy to leave me All alone with the memory Of my days in the sun If you touch me, Youll understand what happiness is Look, a new day has begun"
