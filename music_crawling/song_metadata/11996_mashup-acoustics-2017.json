I can show you incredible things \"Oh my God, look at that face.. you look like my next mistake Love’s a game, wanna play?\" New money, suit and tie... I can read you like a magazine Ain't it funny? Rumors fly and I know you heard about me Grab your passport and my hand I can make the bad guys good for a weekend So it's gonna be forever or it's gonna go down in flames You can tell me when it's over hmmm, if the high was worth the pain Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane Cause you know I love the players and you love the game Cause were young and we're reckless, we'll take this way too far It'll leave you breathless hmmm, or with a nasty scar Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane But I got a blank space baby and GI\"ll write your (chuyển) Hey, I was doing just fine just before I met you I drank too much and that's an issue but I'm okay Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them But I hope I never see them again. I know it breaks your heart Moved to the city in a broke down car and Four years, no calls Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar and I ….. can't stop No, I ….. can't stop. So baby pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover That I know you can't afford Bite that tattoo on your shoulder Pull the sheets right off the corner Of the mattress that you stole From your roommate back in Boulder We ain't ever getting older.  We ain't ever getting older I came in like a wrecking ball I never hit so hard in love All I wanted was to break your walls All you ever did was wreck me Yeah, you wreck me Come on, come on, turn the radio on It’s Friday night and I won’t be long Gotta do my hair, put my make up on It’s Friday night and I won’t be long Til I, hit the dance floor Hit the dance floor I got all I need No I ain’t got cash I ain’t got cash But I got you baby Baby I don’t need dollar bills to have fun tonight (I love cheap thrills) (x2) But I don’t need no mo..neyyy.. As long as I can feel.. the beat.. I don’t need no mo..neyyy.. As long as I keep  dan..cinggg.. Na, na, na, na, na, na, na"
