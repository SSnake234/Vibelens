  "lyrics": "    When you're here before Couldn't look you in the eye You're just like an angel Your skin makes me cry You float like a feather In a beautiful world You're so fucking special And I wish I was special But I'm a creep I'm a weirdo What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here I don't care if it hurts I wanna have control I Wanna perfect body I Wanna perfect soul I want you to notice When I'm not around You're so very special I wish I was special But I'm a creep I'm a weirdo What the hell am I doing here? When I don't belong here She's runn ing on agai n,  she's runn ing on, ...she run, run, run ru- un,  ru-un ... Whatever makes you happy Whatever you want You're so fucking special I wish I was special But I'm a creep I'm a weirdo What the hell am I doing here I don't belong here I don't belong here"
