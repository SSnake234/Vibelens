You can take everything I have You can break everything I am Like Im made of glass Like Im made of paper Go on and try to tear me down I will be rising from the ground Like a skyscraper Like a skyscraper As the smoke clears I awaken and untangle you from me Would it make feel better To watch me while I bleed? All my windows, still are broken But Im standing on my feet You can take everything I have You can break everything I am Like Im made of glass Like Im made of paper Go on and try to tear me down I will be rising from the ground Like a skyscraper Like a skyscraper Go run, run, run Im gonna stay right here Watch you disappear Go run run run Yeah its a long way down But Im closer to clouds up here You can take everything I have You can break everything I am Like Im made of glass Like Im made of paper Go on and try to tear me down I will be rising from the ground Like a skyscraper (Like a skyscraper) Like a skyscraper Like a skyscraper  "
