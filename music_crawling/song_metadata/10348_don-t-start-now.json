Maybe, but look at where I ended up I'm all good already So moved on it's scary I'm not where you left me at all, so If you don't wanna see me dancing with some body If you wanna be lieve that anything could stop me Don't show up Don't come out Don't start caring about me now Walk a way You know how Don't start caring about me now Aren't you the guy who tried to Hurt me with the word \"good bye\"? Though it took some time to survive you I'm better on the other side I'm all good already So moved on, it's scary I'm not where you left me at all, so If you don't wanna see me dancing with some body If you wanna be lieve that anything could stop me Don't show up Don't come out Don't start caring about me now Walk a way You know how Don't start caring about me now Up, up, don't come out, out, out Don't show up, up, up Don't start now (oh) Up, up, don't come out, out, out I'm not where you left me at all, so If you don't wanna see me dancing with some body If you wanna be lieve that anything could stop me Don't show up (don't show up) Don't come out (don't come out) Don't start caring about me now ('bout me now) Walk a way (walk away) You know how (you know how) Don't start caring about me now (so) Up, up, don't come out, out, out Don't show up, up, up Walk away, walk away, so Up, up, don't come out, out, out Don't show up, up, up Walk away, walk away, oh"
