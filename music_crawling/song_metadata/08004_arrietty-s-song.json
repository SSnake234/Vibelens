  "lyrics": "Intro     I'm 14 years old, I am pretty. I’m a teeny tiny girl, a little lady. I Live under the kitchen floor, right here, not so far from you. Some times I feel happy, some times I feel blue. In my dreams..Oh! I wish I could~ my hair blowing in the wind, see the sky in the summer rain. Pick a flower from the garden for you.. Beyond the lane, there’s another world, butter flies floating in air.. But is there someone out there for me..? And so life goes on, day after day With knick-knacks on the floor, nooks and crannies I live in a tiny world I live in a tiny world But out there, some one waits for me. I wish I had someone to watch over me In my dreams Oh I wish I could... my hair blowing in the wind, see the sky in the summer rain. Pick a flower from the garden for you.. Beyond the lane, there’s another world, butter flies floating in air.. But is there someone out there for me..?"
