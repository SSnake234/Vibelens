  "lyrics": "(I'm) sinking myself into overflowing glasses Crying drunk tears, drink with me 'til we fly off the ground Those days have gone so far with the passion we had The eyes of blues drifting away as the wind blows Get drunk with me, sing with me and cry with me One more time So I can be next to your heart for a while (The) vision of you blurred when I was drowning Guess it's way too much for you to bear Though it's impossible for us To be together to walk the miles And keep the hope for a new dawn Life goes on with the ups and downs Then we just fell out Keep getting drunk to lose our minds, to burn our hearts"
