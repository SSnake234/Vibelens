  "lyrics": "    Every time I think I'm closer to the heart Of what it means to know just who I am I think I've finally found a better place to start But no one ever seems to understand I need to try to get to where you are Could it be, you're not that far? You're the voice I hear inside my head The reason that I'm singin' I need to find you, I gotta find you You're the missin' piece I need The song inside of me I need to find you, I gotta find you, oh yeah    Been feelin' lost, can't find the words to say Spendin' all my time stuck in yesterday Where you are is where I wanna be Oh, next to you and you next to me  Oh, I need to find you, yeah"
