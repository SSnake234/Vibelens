When we talk, you say it softly But I love it when you're awfully quiet , hmm , quiet You see a piece of paper Could be a little greater Show me what you could make her You'll never know until you try it  You don't have to keep it quiet And I know it makes you ner- vous But I promise you, it's worth it To show 'em every- thing you kept in- side Don't hide, don't hide Too shy to say, but I hope you stay Don't hide a- way Come out and play Look up, out of your w indow See snow, won't let it in though Leave home, feel the wind blow 'Cause it's colder here in side in silence You don't have to keep it quiet Yeah, I know it makes you ner- vous But I promise you, it's worth it To show 'em every- thing you kept in- side Don't hide, don't hide Too shy to say, but I hope you stay Don't hide a- way Come out and play"
