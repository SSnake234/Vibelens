Diddy Put my glasses on, I'm out the door I'm gonna hit this city Before I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack Cause when I leave for the night, I ain't coming back I'm talking pedicure on our toes, toes Trying on all our clothes, clothes Boys blowin' up our phones, phones drop-topin' Playing our favorite CDs Pulling up to the parties Trying to get a little bit tipsy Don't stop, make it pop, DJ blow my speakers up Tonight, I'mma fight 'til we see the sunlight Tick tock, on the clock But the party don't stop, no Woah oh oh oh Woah oh oh oh Ain't got a care in world, but got plenty of beer Ain't got no money in my pocket, but I'm already here And now, the dudes are linin' up cause they hear we got swagger But we kick 'em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger I'm talking about everybody getting crunk, crunk Boys tryin' to touch my junk, junk Gonna smack him if he getting too drunk, drunk now, now We go until they kick us out, out Or the police shut us down, down Po-po shut us Don't stop, make it pop, DJ blow my speakers up Tonight, I'mma fight 'til we see the sunlight Tick tock, on the clock But the party don't stop, no Woah oh oh oh Woah oh oh oh (DJ), you build me up you break me down My heart, it pounds yeah, you got me With my hands up You got me now You got that sound, yeah, you got me (DJ), you build me up you break me down My heart, it pounds yeah, you got me With my hands put your hands up Put your hands up Don't stop, make it pop, DJ blow my speakers up Tonight, I'mma fight 'til we see the sunlight Tick tock, on the clock But the party don't stop, no Woah oh oh oh Woah oh oh oh"
