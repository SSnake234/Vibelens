I've done my time Now I've got to know what is and is it mine If you received my letter telling you I'd soon be free Then you'll know just what to do if you still want me. If you still want me Oh, tie a yellow ribbon 'round the ole oak tree It's been three long years Do you still want me If I don't see a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree I'll (/C)stay on the bus Put the blame on me If I don't see a yellow ribbon 'round the ole oak tree."
