  "lyrics": " Tell me are you feeling strong, Strong enough to love someone, And make it through the hardest storm, Will you pull me from the flames, Hold me till I feel no pain, And give me shelter from the rain, Where can I find, her? She took the light and left me in the dark, She left me with a broken heart, Now Im on my own. If any body sees her (Hey hey hey) Shine a light on her (Hey hey hey) Shine a light on her (Hey hey hey) Shine a light on her (Hey hey) Tell me can you hear my voice, Loud and clear above the noise, And even if I had the choice,"
