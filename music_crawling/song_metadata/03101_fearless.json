  "lyrics": "Intro:  There's something 'bout the way The street looks when it's just me There's a glow off the pavement Walk me to the car And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there In the middle of the parking lot Yeah... Oh Yeah I wonder if you know I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now But you're just so cool Run your hands through your hair Absent-mindedly making me want you And I don't know how it gets better than this You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless And I don't know why but with you I'd dance In a storm in my best dress, fearless  So baby drive slow till we run out of road In this one horse town I wanna stay right here in this passenger seat you put your eyes on me In this moment now capture it remember it Cause I don't know how it gets better than this You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless And I don't know why but with you I'd dance In a storm in my best dress, fearless Yea you stood there with me in the doorway my hands shake & im not usually this way But you pull me in & im a little more brave It's a first kiss, it's flawless, really something It's fearless  Ohh.. Yeah And I don't know how it gets better than this You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless And I don't know why but with you I'd dance In a storm in my best dress, fearless Yeah I don't know how Oh.. oh, yeah, yeah"
