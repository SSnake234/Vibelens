  "lyrics": "If I got locked away And we lost it all today Tell me honestly would you still love me the same If I couldn't be strong Tell me honestly would you still love me the same If I judge for life babe would you stay by my side Or is you gonna say goodbye Can you tell me right now If I couldn't buy you the fancy things in life Shawty would it be alright Come on show me that you down Now tell me would you really ride for me Baby tell me would you die for me Would you spend your whole life with me Would you be there to always hold me down Baby don't lie to me If I didn't have anything I wanna know would you stick around If I got locked away And we lost it all today Tell me honestly would you still love me the same If I showed you my flaws If I couldn't be strong Tell me honestly would you still love me the same Let's get it down All I wanna is somebody who really don't need much A girl that I know I can trust To be there when money low If I did not have nothing else to give but love Would that even be enough Gal, me need to know Now tell me would you really ride for me Baby tell me would you die for me Would you spend your whole life with me Would you be there to always hold me down Tell me would you really cry for me Baby don't lie to me If I didn't have anything I wanna know would you stick around If I got locked away And we lost it all today Tell me honestly would you still love me the same If I showed you my flaws If I couldn't be strong Tell me honestly would you still love me the same Tell me tell me would you call me If you knew I wasn't balling Cause I need girl who's always by my side Tell me tell me do you need me Tell me tell me do you love me Or is it just tryna play me Cause I need a girl to hold me down for life If I got locked away And we lost it all today Tell me honestly would you still love me the same If I couldn't be strong Tell me honestly would you still love me the same"
