  "lyrics": "You, with your words like knives and swords You, have knocked me off my feet again Got me feelin' like a nothin' You, with your voice like nails on a chalk board Callin' me out when I'm wounded You, pickin' on the weaker man Well you can take me down with just one single blow But you don't know, what you don't know Someday I'll be livin in a big ol' city And all you're ever gonna be is mean Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me And all you're ever gonna be is mean Why you gotta be so mean? You, with your swithching sides and Your wild fire lies and your humiliation You, have pointed out my flaws again I walk with my head down tryin' to block you out I just wanna feel okay again I bet you got pushed around Somebody made you cold But the cycle ends right now 'cause You can't lead me down that road And you don't know what you don't know Someday I'll be livin in a big ol' city And all you're ever gonna be is mean Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me And all you're ever gonna be is mean Why you gotta be so mean? And I can see you years from now in a bar Talkin' over a football game With that same big loud opinion But no one's listening same old bitter things Drunk and rumblin' all about how I can't sing But all you are is mean All you are is mean, and a liar, and pathetic And alone in life and mean, and mean , and mean, and mean Someday I'll be livin in a big ol' city And all you're ever gonna be is mean Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me And all you're ever gonna be is mean Why you gotta be so mean?"
