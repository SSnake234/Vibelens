  "lyrics": "     I've been watching you For some time Can't stop staring At those oceans eyes Burn- ing cities And na- palm skies Fif- teen flares inside those ocean eyes Your ocean eyes No fair   You really know how to make me cry When you gimme those ocean eyes I'm scared   I've never fallen from quite this high Falling into your ocean eyes Those ocean eyes I've been walking through A world gone blind Can't stop thinking of your diamond mind Care- ful creature Made friends with time He left her lonely with a diamond mind And those ocean eyes"
