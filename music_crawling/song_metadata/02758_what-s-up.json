  "lyrics": " Twenty-five years of my life and still I'm trying to get up that great big hill of hope For a destination I realized quickly when I knew I should That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man For whatever that means And so I cry sometimes when I lie in my bed Just to get it all out what's in my head And I'm...i'm feeling little peculiar. And so I wake in the morning and I step outside And I take a deep breath and I get real high And I scream from the top of my lungs What's going on? And I say, \"Hey yeah yeah hey, hey yeah yeah.\" I said, \"Hey, what's going on?\" And I say, \"Hey yeah yeah hey, hey yeah yeah.\" I said, \"Hey, what's going on?\" Oooh ohh...  Verse And I try, oh my god, do I try I try all the time, in this institution. And I pray, oh my god, do I pray I pray every single day, for a revolution. And so I cry sometimes, when I'm lying in bed just to get all out, what's in my head, then I, I'm feeling, a little peculiar. And so I wake in the morning, and I step outside And I take a deep breath, and I get real high, and I, scream from the top of my lungs, \"What's going on?\" And I say, \"Hey yeah yeah hey, hey yeah yeah.\" I said, \"Hey, what's going on?\" And I say, \"Hey yeah yeah hey, hey yeah yeah.\" I said, \"Hey, what's going on?\" Oooh ohh...  Verse 25 years of my life and still Tryin' to get up that great big hill of hope for a destination.  "
