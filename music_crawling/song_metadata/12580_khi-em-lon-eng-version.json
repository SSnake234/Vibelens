When you grow up The sky is like a work of art Without a doubt you're running Too fast, yet do you know? When you grow up You will fall harder than now Life ain't what it sounds like You realize they pay no mind Who would you cry to? Because no one wants to hear What they don't wanna hear Then you're silent..... Huhuhuhuhuhuhu x3   When you grow up There'll be times you'll fall in love Building hopes to someone you think might be the one When you grow up There'll be times that you wanna give There'll be times that you wanna trust Without a doubt When you grow up What you thought right turns out wrong Lies falling down their tongues Holding broken pieces of your heart Who would you cry to? Because no one wants to hear What they don't wanna hear Then you're silent   When you're older It's so hard to go home Used to be easy Now you can't even breathe How you fall! You wish you'd never grown up   Em à... You will fall and fall again Your feet will be in pain But you'll wash it away in the rain Even when you're alone Baby you just gotta hear What they don't wanna hear  "
