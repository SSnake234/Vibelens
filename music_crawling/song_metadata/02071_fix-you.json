  "lyrics": "When you try your best but you don't succeed When you get what you want but not what you need When you feel so tired but you can't sleep Stuck in re verse  And the tears come streaming down your face When you lose something you can't re place When you love someone but it goes to waste Could it be worse?  ...Lights will guide you home And ig nite your bones and I will try to fix you And high up above or down below When you're too in love to let it go But if you never try you'll never know Just what you're worth  ...Lights will guide you home And ig nite your bones and I will try to fix you ...Tears stream down your face when you lose something you cannot replace ...Tears stream down your face and I ...Tears stream down your face when you lose something you cannot replace ...Tears stream down your face and I ...Lights will guide you home And ig nite your bones and I will try to fix you"
