  "lyrics": "I've always felt so awkward And maybe that's the reason E ven the greed in side me, I just can't let go Life's beauty trapped in side a stone. And right now, I feel happy The sea is calm before the storm A fire that I fear would take me and burn to dust And so for love, I'm cheering on. We are the young The rings on a tree stump, we can't see Blind ed by lights That burn so bright, but fad ing a way Ah ah ah ah ah Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah~ Ah ah ah ah ah Ah ah ah ah ah Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah~ The sadness of adulthood, You've overgrown your twenties A fire that you fear would take you and burn to dust And so for love, we're cheering on. We are the young The rings on a tree stump, we can't see Blind ed by lights That burn so bright, but fad ing a way Of course, it's true I didn't know that much back then And our differences were the same. Then you matured And you fell into it first And I guess I followed you a gain. We are the young The rings on a tree stump, we can't see Blind ed by lights That burn so bright, but fad ing a way Ah ah ah ah ah Ah ah ah ah ah Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah~ Ah ah ah ah ah Ah ah ah ah ah Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah~"
