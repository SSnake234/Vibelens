  "lyrics": "tone gốc: Cm capo 3 chơi Please let the shyness be what matters Let the heart make way to the silent moment A little push for glances and our lips to touch and bring the heat Please let us melt right into this desire When you come by, life is filled with heaven’s scent And then once again, this world is full of love The day I have you here Loving softly in dream lands Looking for beauty and… We’d flow in the music together Mind got blown as I walk with you 1000 lives I’d wait for you As long as I have the time to love….. Cuz baby it’s always you It's always you It’s like I have tasted all the passion in life A thousand lives are in 1 sec. you’re by my side Cuz when you look at me in the eyes I suddenly go up on cloud nine Every day I wake up hearing your voice At night I share with you all my beautiful noise Innocent and sweet too, to the moon I’ll take you Keeping our hearts together as the love goes high And I‘d want to trade a whole lot of sunshine for your heat Let go of money and fame, things that people need Meaningless stuffs got nothing on your lips My life would suck if you re not on my team Looking at you makes every second count My feelings are embeded in my every sound Like the flowers blooming, our love would flourish This thousand-year story would never vanish"
