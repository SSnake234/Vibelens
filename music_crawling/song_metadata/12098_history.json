  "lyrics": "You've gotta help me, I'm losing my mind, keep getting the feeling you want to leave this all behind. Thought we were going strong I thought we were holding on, Aren't we? No, they don't teach you this in school, now my heart's breaking and I don't know what to do. Thought we were going strong, thought we were holding on, aren't we? You and me got a whole lot of history, we could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen. You and me got a whole lot of history, so don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever. All of the rumours, all of the fights, but we always find a way to make it out alive. Thought we were going strong, thought we were holding on Aren't we? You and me got a whole lot of history, we could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen. You and me got a whole lot of history, so don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever. Mini bars, expensive cars, hotel rooms, and new tattoos, the good champagne and private planes, But we don't need anything 'cause the truth is out, I realise that without you here life is just a lie. This is not the end, this is not the end. We can make it you know it, you know You and me got a whole lot of history, we could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen. You and me got a whole lot of history, so don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever. You and me got a whole lot of history, we could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen. You and me got a whole lot of history, so don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever. So don't let me go, so don't let me go. We can live forever, baby don't you know. Baby don't you know we can live forever?"
