  "lyrics": " Ahhh, savage love, Derulo If I woke up without ya Thought I could be single forever Usually don't be fallin', be fallin' fallin' first You gotta way of keeping me comin' back to back I just found out, the only reason that you lovin' me Is to get back at your ex lover but before you leave Usually I would never, would never even care Baby I know she creepin', I feel it in the air Every night and every day I try to make you stay Savage love Break your heart? But your savage love I know you don't give two fucks Your savage love Your savage love-love-love Your savage love-love-love You could use me Baby I hope this ain't karma cos I get around You wanna run it up, I wanna lock it down Usually don't be fallin', be fallin' fallin' first You gotta way of making me spend up all my cash Every night and every day I try to make you stay Savage love Break your heart? But your savage love I know you don't give two fucks Your savage love Your savage love-love-love Your savage love-love-love You could use me Your savage love-love-love Your savage love-love-love You could use me Savage love Break your heart? But your savage love I know you don't give two fucks Your savage love Your savage love-love-love Your savage love-love-love You could use me"
