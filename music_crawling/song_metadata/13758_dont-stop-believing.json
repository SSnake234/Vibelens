  "lyrics": " Just a small town girl, living in a lonely world She took the midnight train going anywhere Just a city boy, born and raised in south Detroit He took the midnight train going anywhere A singer in a smoky room, a smell of wine and cheap perfume For a smile they can share the night, it goes on and on and on and on Strangers waiting up and down the boulevard Their shadows searching in the night Streetlight, people, living just to find emotion Hiding, somewhere in the night Working hard to get my fill, everybody wants a thrill Paying anything to roll the dice, just one more time Some will win, some will lose, some were born to sing the blues Oh, the movie never ends; it goes on and on and on and on Strangers waiting up and down the boulevard Their shadows searching in the night Streetlight, people, living just to find emotion Hiding, somewhere in the night Don't stop believing hold on to the feeling Streetlight people Don't stop believing hold on to the feeling Streetlight people Don't stop believing hold on to the feeling Streetlight people"
