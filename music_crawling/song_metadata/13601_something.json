(Lick 1) Somewhere in her smile she knows, That I don't need no other lover. Something in her style that shows me. I don't wanna leave her now, You know I believe and how  (Lick 2) You're asking me will my love grow, I don't know, I don't know (Walkdown 1) You stick around now, it may show, I don't know, I don't know (Walkdown 2)          Something in the way she knows, And all I have to do i think of her. Something in the things she shows me. I don't wanna leave her now. You know I believe and how.   "
