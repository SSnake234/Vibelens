Does it really matter why, I love you? Anywhere there's a crowd, you stand out, Can't you see why they can't ignore you? If you want to know Why I can't let go Let me explain to you It's every little dream come true And every little thing you do It's every little thing you do That makes me fall in love with you There isn't a way that I can show you Ever since I come to know you It's every little thing you say That makes me wanna feel this way There's not a thing that I can point to Cause it's every little thing you do It's every little thing you do That makes me fall in love with you There isn't a way that I can show you Ever since I come to know you It's every little thing you say That makes me wanna feel this way There's not a thing that I can point to Cause it's every little thing you do"
