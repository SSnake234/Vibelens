In the loneliness of life We've prayed to the Gods for the healing song on your Pain (x4) Frozen sky we've stayed and Sleep inside And how we died alone ? My evenfall downs with the Crimson wine Our tears have cried nomore in The End...We are all alone.... Embracing my heart...with you... A teardrop from your eyes... is the fear drowning in my nights...    "
