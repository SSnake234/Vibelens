  "lyrics": "You want all my love and my devotion You want my love and soul right on the line I have no doubt that I could love you, forever The only trouble is You really don't have the time You've got one night only, One night only That's all you have to spare One night only Lets not pretend to care One night only, One night only Come on big baby come on One night only We only have till dawn In the morning this feeling will be gone It has no chance going on Something so right has got no chance to live So let's forget about chances It's one night I will give One night only, One night only You'll be the only one One night only, then you'll have to run One night only, One night only There's nothing more to say One night only Times getting away"
