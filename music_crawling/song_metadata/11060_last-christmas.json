Once bitten and twice shy Ikeep my distance but you still catch my eye Tell me baby, do you recognize me Well, its been a year it doesn't surprise me Merry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it With a note saying I love you- I meant it Now i know what a fool I've been But if you kiss me now, I know you'll fool me again A crowded room and friends with tired eyes. I'm hiding from you and your sold up eyes. My God I thought you were someone to rely on Me i guess I was a shoulder to cry on. A face on a lover with a fire in his heart A girl under cover but you tore her apart. Maybe this year maybe this year I'll give it to someone special. And last Christmas and this year won't be anything like anything like! Lặp lại lần nữa và kết ở ."
