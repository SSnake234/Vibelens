Ooh ooh ooh ooooh! Don't you worry, don't you worry now There was a time, I met a girl of a different kind We ruled the world, I thought I'll never lose her out of sight,  we were so young I think of her now and then Still hear the songs reminding me of a friend ...Up on the hill across the blue lake , thats where I had my first heart break I still remember how it all changed my father said Don't you worry, don't you worry child See heaven's got a plan for you Don't you worry, don't you worry now Yeah! Ooh ooh ooh ooooh! Don't you worry, don't you worry now Ah...... ...... . Ah...... ...... . Ah... Don't you worry, don't you worry child See heaven's got a plan for you Don't you worry, don't you worry now Ah...... ...... . Ah...... ...... . Ah...... ...... ."
