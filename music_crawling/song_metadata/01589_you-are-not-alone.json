  "lyrics": "Another day has gone, I'm still all a lone, How could this be? You're not here with me. You never said goodbye, someone tell me why, Did you have to go, and leave my world so c old? Ever yday I sit and ask myself : How did love slip away ? Something whispers in my ear and s ays that... You are not alone, for I am here with you. Though you're far away, I am here to stay. But you are not a lone, for I am here with you, Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart, But you are not alone. No. .. 'Lone, why? 'Lo ne... Just the other n ight I thought I heard you cry, Asking me to come, and hold you in my arms. I can hear your p rayers, your burdens I will b ear, But first I need your hand, then forever can b egin. Everyday I sit and ask myself : How did love slip away ? Something whispers in my ear and s ays that... You are not alone, for I am here with you. Though you're far away, I am here to stay. But you are not alone, for I am here with you, Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart, You are not alone, for I am here with you. Though you're far away, I am here to stay. But you are not alone, for I am here with you, Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart, But you are not alone. No. .. 'Lone, why? 'Lo ne... But you are not alone, for I am here with you. Though you're far away, I am here to stay. But you are not alone, for I am here with you, Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart, But you are not alone."
