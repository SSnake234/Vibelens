  "lyrics": "Eyes blue or brown, can't remember A lot of time has passed, Since third of December. Eyes green or gray, can't remember But I bet you know, The color of Heather's. Getting cold, but I have my own sweater, F your polyester, cause cotton's way better. You were, Play ing Jack and Rose, when you sunk only you froze, Cause you gave her your sweater. You're lost in the Atlantic, Try ing not to panic But now it's too late to come back I moved on and I'm better, know my worth, I'm Heather Eyes blue or brown, can't remember A lot of time has passed, Since third of December. Eyes green or gray, can't remember But I bet you know, The color of Heather's."
