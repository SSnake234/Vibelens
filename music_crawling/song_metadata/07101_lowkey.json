This liquid courage got me way too honest Put your phone on vibrate, let's catch a vibe babe while the sun's down Hush now, I know we're a little too fucked up to stay still, love Be as quiet as you can 'cause if anyone sees they'll just blow shit up I don't gotta know if you're taken, I'll just let ya know bedroom's vacant No on's gotta know, just us and the moon 'til the sun starts waking Up's the only direction I see Low - low - low - low - low - low - low - low key (ah - ah, ah - ah) You ain't even got to lo - lo - lo - lo Lo - lo - lo - love me (ah - ah, ah - ah) Us in a king-size, keep it a secret Say I'm your queen, I don't wanna leave this Low - low - low - low - low - low - low - low key Wizard with words, telling' me my energy's so bewitching So I'll go first, there's an open bar, let's close this distance Oh my, don't make me have to spell it all night I don't really give a fuck about all the 'he said, she said' bullshit So pick your poison love, let's go somewhere a little more exclusive Take a shot, take a chance, take my hand boy Tension so intense like an asteroid Be discreet, gotta dodge all the tabloids Let's not think too much, there ain't no problems Low - low - low - low - low - low - low - low key (ah - ah, ah - ah) You ain't even got to lo - lo - lo - lo Lo - lo - lo - love me (ah - ah, ah - ah) Us in a king-size, keep it a secret Say I'm your queen, I don't wanna leave this Low - low - low - low - low - low - low - low key"
