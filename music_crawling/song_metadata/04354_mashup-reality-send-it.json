Send it to my phone, send it to my phone You already know I keep it on the low Baby, you can trust , me promise I'm alone I won't tell a soul, send it to my phone. Decisions as I go, to anywhere I flow. Sometimes I believe, a time where we should know. I can fly high, I can go long. Today I got a million, tomorrow, I don't know. Decisions as I go, to anywhere I flow. Sometimes I believe, a time where we should know. I can fly high, I can go long. Today I got a million, tomorrow, I don't know."
