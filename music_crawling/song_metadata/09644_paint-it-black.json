  "lyrics": "...I see a red door and I want it painted black. ...No colours anymore I want them to turn black. ..I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes. I have to turn my head un- til my darkness goes. ...I see a line of cars and they're all painted black. ...With flowers and by love both never to come back. ...I see people turn their heads and quickly look away. Like a new born baby it just happens every day. ...I look inside myself and see my heart is black. ...I see my red door and I want it painted black. ...Maybe then I'll fade a- way and not have to face the facts. It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black. ...No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue. ...I could not forsee this thing happening to you. ...If I look hard e- nough in- to the setting sun ...My love will laugh with me be- fore the morning comes. ...I see a red door and I want it painted black. ...No colours anymore I want them to turn black. ...I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes. I have to turn my head un- til my darkness goes. Hm Hm Hm Hm Hm Hm Hm Hm Hm Hm Hm hmmm..."
