Nobody but you, ‘body but m e, ‘body but us, bodies together. I’d love to hold you close, tonight and always, I’d love to wake up n ext to you. I’d love to hold you cl ose, tonight and always, I’d l ove to wake up next to y ou. So we’ll piss off the neighbours, In the pl ace that feels the tears, the place to lose your fears. Yeah, r eckless behavior, A pl ace that is so pure , so dirty and raw. Be in the b ed all day, bed all day, bed all day, Fucking you, and fighting on. It’s our pa radise and it’s our war zone, It’s our pa radise and it’s our war zone. Pillow talk, my enemy, my allY. Pr isoners, the n we’re free, it’s a thriller. I’m seeing the p ain, seeing the pleasure. Nobody but you, ‘body but m e, ‘body but us, bodies together. I’d love to hold you close, tonight and always, I’d love to wake up n ext to you. So we’ll piss off the neighbours, In the pl ace that feels the tears, the place to lose your fears. Yeah, r eckless behavior, A pl ace that is so pure , so dirty and raw. Be in the b ed all day, bed all day, bed all day, Fucking you, and fighting on. It’s our pa radise and it’s our war zone, It’s our pa radise and it’s our war zone. E Paradise, paradise, paradise, paradise War zone, war zone, war zone, war zone Paradise, paradise, paradise, paradise War zone, war zone, war zone, war zone   So we’ll piss off the neighbours, In the pl ace that feels the tears, the place to lose your fears. Yeah, r eckless behavior, A pl ace that is so pure , so dirty and raw. Be in the b ed all day, bed all day, bed all day, Fucking you, and fighting on.
