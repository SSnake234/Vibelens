Gotta fix that calendar I have That's marked July 15th Because since there's no more you There's no more anniversary I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you And your memory And how every song reminds me I'm so sick of love songs So tired of tears So done with wishing you were still here Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow So why can't I turn off the radio? ( Leave me alone) ( Stupid love songs) Don't make me think about her smile Or having my first child I'm letting go Turning off the radio 'Cause I'm so sick of love songs So tired of tears So done with wishing she were still here Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow So why can't I turn off the radio?"
