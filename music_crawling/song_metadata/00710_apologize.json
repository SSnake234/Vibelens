It's too late to apologize, It's too late I said it's too late to apologize It's too late I'd take another chance, take a fall Take a shot for you And I need you like a heart needs a beat But it's nothin new I loved you with a fire red Now it's turning blue, and you say \"Sorry\" like the angel heaven let me think was you But I'm afraid... It's too late to apologize, It's too late I said It's too late to apologize, It's too late * I'm holdin on your rope, got me ten feet off the ground..."
