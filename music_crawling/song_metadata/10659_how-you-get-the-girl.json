  "lyrics": " Stand there like a ghost Shaking from the rain (rain) She'll open up the door and say \"Are you insane?\" Say it's been a long six months And you were too afraid to tell her what you want. And that's how it works. That's how you get the girl I want you for worse or for better I would wait for ever and ever Broke your heart, I'll put it back together I would wait for ever and ever. And that's how it works How you get the girl, girl And that's how it works How you get the girl, girl. Remind her how we used to be, be With pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks, cheeks Tell her how you must have lost your mind When you left her all alone and never tell her why, why. And that's how it works That's how you lost the girl And you know That I don't want you to go. Remind me how we used to be Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks And say you want me, yeah. I want you for worse or for better I would wait for ever and ever Broke your heart, I'll put it back together I want you forever and ever. And that's how it works How you get the girl, girl And that's how it works How you get the girl,(get the girl). And that's how it works How you get the girl, girl. And that's how it works That's how you've got the girl."
