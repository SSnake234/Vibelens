Now I'm all alone cryin' ugly Y ou broke my heart just for fun Took my l ove and just left me numb Now it's 8:00 in the morning H ate in the morning (All because of you) Another story that's sad and true? I can feel the pain, can you? let me down, to color me blue Hate to see you with someone new I’ll put a curse on her and you now you're dead and gone My love is gone too All my love is gone-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o- one All my love is gone-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o- one All my love is gone-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o- one All my love is gone Now you’re dead and gone All my love is gone and the hate is gone I 'm standing all alone And I'm searching for something But I can't feel nothing I’ve packed my bags and go on Too much darkness for a rainbow, I feel so used live without you? I refuse (Yeah) I just wanna be the one But to you we're already done Tell me, why'd you have to hit and run me? Now I'm all alone cryin' ugly Y ou broke my heart just for fun Took my love and just left me numb Now it's 8:00 in the morning Hate in the morning Another story that's sad and true? I can feel the pain, can you? le t me down, to color me bl ue Hate to see you with someone new I'll put a curse on her and you now you're dead and gone My love is gone too All my love is gone-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o- one All my love is gone-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o- one All my love is gone-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o- one All my love is gone Now you’re dead and gone"
