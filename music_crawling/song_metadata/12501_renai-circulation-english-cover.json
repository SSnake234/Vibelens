Wait a second, that ain't right Every journey's gotta start with a step So go on out there and give it your best I'm takin' a chance cuz I like you a lot So I'll give it a shot, give it all that I got La de da de da La de da de de Suddenly you call my name And I lose my brain And I float up to the moon La de da de de La de da de da When you laugh it makes me smile And I love your style So I wrote a song to this tune Thank you stars for giving to me The greatest gift that's still yet to be I don't mind if fate's playing games I'm happy all the same It's so hard to say it But darling let's face it These feelings revealing Cannot be ignored So I'll work on this letter 'Til our timing gets better Sincerely, yours truly And forevermore"
