Ooh, don't wanna cry but I break that way     Cold sheets, oh, where's my love? I am searching high, I'm searching low in the night Ooh, does she know that we bleed the same? Ooh, don't wanna cry but I break that way Did she run away Did she run away, I don't know If she ran away If she ran away, come back home    I got a fear, oh, in my blood She was carried up into the clouds, high above If you're there I bleed the same If you're scared I'm on my way Did you run away Did you run away, I don't need to know If you ran away If you ran away, come back home   "
