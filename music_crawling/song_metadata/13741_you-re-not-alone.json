  "lyrics": "She's getting out of bed At half past ten She starts to comb her hair Just an ordinary day She looks at her reflection Off the wall Why do I care at all Just an ordinary day An ordinary day That's hurting you Don't hide out inside yourself If you only let the sunshine on you I promise you You're not alone When the lights go out at night When you're feeling lost inside You're not alone You're not alone You're not alone When your world is falling down I will be the one around You 're not alone You're not alone She's waiting for the bus it's 12.59 She's sitting on her own Just an ordinary day She's looking at the people Passing her by It could be you and I They would never dream Of slowing down To see if she's alright Don't hide out inside yourself If you only let the sunshine on you I promise you You're not alone When the lights go out at night When you're feeling lost inside You're not alone You're not alone You're not alone When your world is falling down I will be the one around You're not alone You're not alone You're not alone You're not alone I'm so alone You're not alone When the lights go out at night When you're feeling lost inside  You're not alone You're not alone When your world is falling down I will be the one around  You're not alone"
