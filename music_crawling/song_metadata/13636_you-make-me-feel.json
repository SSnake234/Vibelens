  "lyrics": " Deep in the night, when I'm alone. My heart starts to burn, cause I feel for you. I've been away too long from my love. I leave it up to you to under stand. I've got that feeling, deep in my mind. Come back and love me, just one more time. On the ground of an ocean, we buried our love far away. My heart's still bleeding, won't you come back and stay. But I can't understand, why there's salt in my eyes. And I can't understand, why your heart’s in disguise. For I still need you, and I want you to come back again. You make me feel like never again. I can't find the answer from a look in your eyes. My heart's still crying. Don't tell me your love’s alive. You’re still the one to take me in to stay in your trace Why don't we give us a second chance. But I can't understand, why you laugh, don’t you cry. And I can't undersand, why I don't say goodbye. For I still need you, and I want you to come back again. You make me feel never again."
