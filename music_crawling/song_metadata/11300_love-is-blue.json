  "lyrics": " Blue, blue, my world is blue Blue is my world now I''m without you Gray, gray, my life is gray Cold is my heart since you went a- way Red, red, my eyes are red'r' Crying for you a- lone in my bed Green, green, my jealous heart I doubted you and now we''re a- part. When we met how the bright sun shone Then love died now the rainbow is gone Black, black, the nights I''ve known Longing for you so lost and alone Gone, gone, the love we knew Blue is my world now I''m without you."
