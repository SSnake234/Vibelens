  "lyrics": "Many nights we've prayed, with no proof anyone could hear In our hearts a hopeful song we barely understood Now we are not afraid, although we know there's much to fear We were moving mountains long before we knew we could There can be miracles, when you believe Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill Who knows what miracles you can achieve When you believe Somehow you will, you will when you believe In this time of fear, when prayer so often proves in vain Hope seemed like the summer birds too swiftly flown away Yet now I'm standing here, my heart's so full, I can't explain Seeking faith and speaking words I never thought I'd say There can be miracles, when you believe Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill Who knows what miracles you can achieve When you believe Somehow you will, you will when you believe  They don’t always happen when you ask And it’s easy to give in to your fear But when you’re blinded by your pain Can’t see your way safe through the rain Thought of a still resilient voice Says love is very near There can be miracles, when you believe Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill Who knows what miracles you can achieve When you believe Somehow you will, now you will You will when you believe You will when you believe"
