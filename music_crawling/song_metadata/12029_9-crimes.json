Yeah To give my gun away when it's loaded Is that alright? Yeah If you don't shoot it how am I supposed to hold it Is that alright? Yeah To give my gun away when it's loaded Is that alright Is that alright with you? Leave me out with the waste This is not what I do It's the wrong kind of place To be cheating on you It's the wrong time But she's pulling me through It's a small crime And I've got no excuse Is that alright ? Yeah Give my gun away when it's loaded Is that alright? Yeah If you don't shoot it how am I supposed to hold it Is that alright? Yeah Give my gun away when it's loaded Is that alright Is that alright with you? Is that  alright? Is that  alright? Is that alright with  you? Is that alright? Is that alright? Is that alright with you?  No...  "
