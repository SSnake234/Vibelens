  "lyrics": "I see lovely memories I see how they visit me And my soul is like cloud Slowly fading out I see rainbow on the sky Bringing colors down to play Seems so close but way too far Our youth is just like a cloud Way back to home no longer holds me back There was my yesterday Turn and you''ll see when all the storms will pass Yellow flower on the grass Feeling calm like summer breeze"
