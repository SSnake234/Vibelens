'Cause it's too cold whoa For you here And now So let me hold whoa Both your hands in the holes of my sweater 'Cause it's too cold whoa For you here And now So let me hold whoa Both your hands in the holes of my sweater  Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa... Whoa, whoa... -x4- 'Cause it's too cold whoa For you here And now So let me hold whoa Both your hands in the holes of my sweater 'Cause it's too cold whoa For you here And now So let me hold whoa Both your hands in the holes of my sweater It's too cold, it's too cold The hands of my sweater."
