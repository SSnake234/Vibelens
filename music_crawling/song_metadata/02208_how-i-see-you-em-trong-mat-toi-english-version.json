  "lyrics": "Pretty without makeup You look very angelic hoooooo Dont need jeans or high heels, you choose for yourself Ao Dai, so fine Like the blooming flowers giving off those colors, they dont look half as pretty as you Your softly blowing Ao Dai, representing shining beauty from Eastern lands Are you an angel or am I just... Flooded in awe by you and your charming beauty A viet woman, in her Ao Dai Radiating... Oriental... woah woah  One day by chance in foreign lands she came my way A white flutter pretty shoulders unfamiliar A warming heat I felt complete... oh my homeland... I love you ... I miss you ..."
