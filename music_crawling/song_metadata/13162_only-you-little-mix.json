  "lyrics": "Dancing with your silhouette in the places that we met Ooh, tryna find you in the moon Paris never feels the same, when the streets all call your name Ooh, so I hide in crowded rooms And I'll follow right down the river Where the ocean meets the sky To you, to you Once upon a time we had it all Somewhere down the line we went and lost it One brick at a time we watch it fall I'm broken here tonight and darling, no one else can fix me Only you, Only you And no one else can fix me, only you,oh Only you Did I let go of your hand for a castle made of sanD Ooh, that fell into the blue I went following the sun to be alone with everyone Ooh, looking ' round a crowded room And I'll follow right down the river Where the ocean meets the sky To you, to you Once upon a time we had it all Somewhere down the line we went and lost it One brick at a time we watch it fall I'm broken here tonight and darling, no one else can fix me Only you, Only you And no one else can fix me, only you,oh Only you"
