  "lyrics": "I wanna be there with you when the season comes and goes We're taking the trip to see the world, it's going going on Car, train or ship, even by airplane We make a plan and fantasize it every sunday Oh, it's so nice in spring time and we're just relaxing outside Flowers all around us, like we're in the world of fantasy When the summer comes, we are having a barbecue Waiting for night time, so I get to see the fireworks with you When the fall comes, all the leaves'll turn gold When the winter comes, now everything is covered by the snow Every single season, it seems so brand new When I can spend it with you Let me know, the things you wanna see in spring time Let me know, the things you wanna see in summer time When the flowers bloom, when the sun shines bright I wanna be with you I gotta be with you All the memories of the good days, they never fade away We've been through ups and downs ever since the first day Sometimes we argue and fuss But the every single day is a blessing for the two of us Oh this is where I'm supposed to be cuz you got a hold on me The feelings get stronger everytime you look at me And I gotta say that you're the one I need Remember the day I made a promise to you right by the sea Oh so many nights I made you cry, You still stayed right by my side give me a sign when you're feeling down so I can treat you right Cuz we used to cry together til the break of the dawn Every you said to me still keeps me going strong, so We've been through the good times, And we've been through the bad times Let me show you how I feel, Here are my words of honesty No matter where you are, no matter where you go I know I got to be with you, so So baby talk to me, baby smile for me We chill out and time goes by slowly We just joke around and talk about the stupidest things And when we get enough of it, we look for another place You know I would go anywhere, just to be by your side Let's go out and take a drive under the beautiful sky We've been to a lot of places, but we still we have to go You know there's gotta be so much more Someday we start a family and have a baby You know we gotta take him to the place that we used to hang around The place where we met and the place we belong The place where we made our promise to love forever"
