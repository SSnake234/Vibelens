  "lyrics": "Nothing's impossible Nothing's unreachable When I am weary You make me stronger This love is beautiful So unfor- gettable I feel no winter cold When we're to- gether When we're to- gether Will you stand by me? Hold on and never let me go Will you stand by me? With you I know I belong When the story gets told When day turns into night I look into your eyes I see my future now All the world and its wonder This love wont fade away And through the hardest days I'll never question us You are the reason My only reason Will you stand by me? Hold on and never let me go Will you stand by me? With you I know I belong When the story gets told I am blessed To find what I need In a world loosing hope You're my only believe You make things right Everytime after time Key change up ½ tone to ---------- Will you stand by me? (Stand, stand by me) Hold on and never let me go Will you stand by me? (Stand, stand by me) With I be a part of your life When the story gets told * Stand by me (Darling, I want you just stand by me) Stand by me (Darling, I want you just stand by me) Won't you stand? (Darling, I want you just stand by me) Stand by me (Darling, I want you just stand by me) Stand by me"
