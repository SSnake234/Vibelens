  "lyrics": "I found a love for me Darling just dive right in, and follow my lead Well I found a girl beautiful and sweet I never knew you were the someone waiting for me My mama don't like you and she likes every- one And I never like to admit that I was wrong And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own Send me your location lets ...Focus on communicating 'cause I just need the time and place to come through Send me your location lets ...Ride the vibrations I don't need nothing else but you Cause if you like the way you look that much Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' You should go and love yourself The day after tomorrow I'll still be around To catch you when you fall and ever let you down you say that we're forever our love will never end I've tried to come up but it's drowning me to know you'll never feel my soul It's trapped between true love and being alone When my eyes are closed the greatest story told i woke and my dreams are shattered here on the floor And darling I will be loving you till we're  70 And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23  And I'm thinking bout how People fall in love in mysterious ways Maybe just the touch of hand Well me I fall in love with you every single day And I just wanna tell you I am I’m dancing in the dark, with you between my arms Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath But you heard it, darling you look perfect tonight   - "
