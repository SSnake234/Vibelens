  "lyrics": "    Sweet little words made for silence not talk Young heart for love not heartache Dark hair for catching the wind Not to veil the sight of a cold world Kiss while your lips are still red While he's still silent. rest While bosom is still untouched, unveiled Hold another hand While the hand's still without a tool Drown into eyes while they're still blind Love while the night still hides the withering dawn   First day of love never comes back A passionate hour's never a wasted one The violin, the poet's hand Every thawing heart plays your theme with care Kiss while your lips are still red While he's still silent. rest While bosom is still untouched, unveiled Hold another hand While the hand's still without a tool Drown into eyes while they're still blind Love while the night still hides the withering dawn   "
