If you should ever, ever go away There would be lonely tears to cry The sun above would be never shine again There would be teardrops in the sky So hold me close and never let me go And say our love will always be Oh, my darling, I love you so .......You mean everything to me .............. ........ So hold me close and never let me go And say our love will always be Oh, my darling, I love you so .............You mean everything to me ................."
