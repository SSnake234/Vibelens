  "lyrics": "When you're down and troubled and you need some lovin' care And nothing, nothing is going right Close your eyes and think of me and soon I will be there To brighten up even your darkest nights You just call out my name, and you know, wherever I am, I come running to see you again Winter spring summer or fall all you got to do is call And I'll be there, yes I will You've got a friend If the sky a bove you grows dark and full of clouds, and that old north wind begins to blow Keep your head togheter, and call my name out loud Soon you'll hear me knocking at your door Now ain't it good to know that you've got a friend When people can be so cold The'll hurt you, yes and desert you and take your soul if you let them But don't you let them You've got a friend. You've got a friend"
