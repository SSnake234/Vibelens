I walk alone, I walk a.... My shadow's the only one that walks beside me My shallow hearts the only thing that's beating Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me Till then I walk alone Ah-Ah Ah-Ah Ah-Ah Ahhh-Ah haaa-ah Ah-Ah Ah-Ah Ah-Ah I'm walking down the line That divides me somewhere in my mind On the border line of the edge And where I walk alone  Read bet ween the lines What's fucked up and everything's all right Check my vital signs, to know I'm still alive and I walk a lone I walk a lone, I walk a lone. I walk alone, I walk a.... My shadow's the only one that walks beside me My shallow hearts the only thing that's beating Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me Till then I walk alone I walk a... Rhythm:  x3 I walk this empty street, On the Boule vard of broken dreams Where the city sleeps, And I'm the only one and I walk a lone I walk a lone, I walk a lone. Outro: x2"
