  "lyrics": "Baby, can't you see, I'm callin' It's dangerous, I'm fallin' ..You're dangerous, I'm lovin' it Too high, can't come down Losing my head, spinning 'round and 'round Can you feel me now? Taste of your lips, I'm on a ride You're toxic, I'm slippin' under with the taste of your poison paradise I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic? And I love what you do; don't you know that you're toxic? It's getting late to give you up I took a sip from my devil's cup Slowly, it's taking over me Too high, can't come down Losing my head, spinning 'round and 'round Can you feel me now? Taste of your lips, I'm on a ride You're toxic, I'm slippin' under with the taste of your poison paradise I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic? And I love what you do; don't you know that you're toxic? Yeah I love what you do Don't you know that you're toxic    Taste of your lips, I'm on a ride You're toxic, I'm slippin' under with the taste of your poison paradise I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic? And I love what you do; don't you know that you're toxic? Yeah I love what you do Don't you know that you're toxic Intoxicate me now, with your lovin' now I think I'm ready now, I think I'm ready now Intoxicate me now, with your lovin' now I think I'm ready now Intoxicate me now, with your lovin' now I think I'm ready now, I think I'm ready now Intoxicate me now, with your lovin' now I think I'm ready now Intoxicate me now"
