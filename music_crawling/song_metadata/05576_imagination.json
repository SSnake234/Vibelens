  "lyrics": "Oh there she goes again, every morning it's the same You walk on by my house, I wanna call out your name I wanna tell you how be autiful you are from where I'm standing You got me thinking me what we could because I keep craving, craving, you don't know it but it's true Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you This is typical of love, I can't wait anymore, won't wait I need to tell you how I feel when I see us to gether forever In my dreams you're with me We'll be everything I want us to be And from there, who knows? Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time Or is that just me in my imagination? We walk, we laugh, we spend our time walking by the ocean side Our hands are gently inter twined, a feeling I just can't des cribe And all this time we spent alone thinking we cannot be long To something so damn beautiful, so damn beautiful I keep craving, craving, you don't know it but it's true Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you This is typical of love, I can't wait anymore, won't wait I need to tell you how I feel when I see us to gether forever In my dreams you're with me We'll be everything I want us to be And from there, who knows? Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time Or is that just me in my imagination?"
