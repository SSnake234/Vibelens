Was a long and dark December And a fox became God P riests clutched onto bibles And the c ross was held aloft Bury me an armour When I’m dead and hit the ground My nerves are poles that unf roze If you love me, won’t you let me know?  x2 I don’t want to be a soldier Who the captain of some sinking ship Would stow Far below So, if you love me, why’d you let me go? I took my love down to Vio let Hill There we sat in the snow All that time she was sil ent still Said if you love me, won’t you let me know? If you lov e me , wo n’t you le t me kn ow?"
