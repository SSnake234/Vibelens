Lately I've been wishing I was brain dead No responsibilities in my head today Baby let's see what's on the TV Doing nothing having fun off to bed to get things done I'm not lazy I'm in love I don't wanna move I'll just sit here in my living room And see what's on the tube While I'm hanging out with you People pressing my flesh Taking my time thing about my life with you I'm trying real hard Hard not to care Cause all I ever really want to do Is sit around doing nothing with you Because nothing's only fun when you're there \"Mad About You\" at dinnertime \"Seinfeld\" \"Simpsons\" \"So-Called Life\" Seen the reruns 20 million times I don't wanna move I'll just sit here in my living room And see what's on the tube While I'm hanging out with you All I wanna do is just sit here in my living room And see what's on the tube While I'm hanging out with you All I wanna do All I wanna do All I wanna do Is do nothing with you All I wanna do All I wanna do All I wanna do Is do nothing with you Guitar Solo:  ................"
