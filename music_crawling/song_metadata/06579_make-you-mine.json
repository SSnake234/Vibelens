Put your hand in mine You know that I want to be with you all the time You know that I won't stop u ntil I make you mine You know that I won't stop u ntil I make you mine Until I make you mine Until I make you mine Put your hand in mine You know that I want to be with you all the time Oh darling, darling, baby you're so very fine You know that I won't stop u ntil I make you mine Until I make you  "
