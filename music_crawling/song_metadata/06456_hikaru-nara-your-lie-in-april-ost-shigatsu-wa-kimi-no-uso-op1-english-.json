Tell me you know, I’ll never let go As long as you’re here by my side All of our wishes will shine in the night Tomorrow, they’ll shine in the light You’re the light that lead me here, but I always knew that it was you I could feel you calling out and telling me to run When you’re here with me I can see our futures’ll meet So now it’s the time This is where we shine I always knew that it had to be you Now that I see I believe Even the night will fade from our sight I always knew that it had to be you Now that I see I believe So if we try the darkness’ll shine (And) Light up the stars in the sky All of the tears they all disappear As long as you’re here by my side No need to hide your smile in the night So we can be one with the light Is this answer just a game that’s calling my name could it be fate? I’ll wait On this road that’s calling to me, there’s the light that I see All these hopes and dreams tonight I’ll never let go, but even so I know we can make this darkness shine and be finally one with the light"
