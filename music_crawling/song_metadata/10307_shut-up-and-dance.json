  "lyrics": "  Oh don't you dare look back Just keep your eyes on me. I said you're holding back, She said shut up and dance with me! This woman is my destiny She said oh oh oh Shut up and dance with me  X2 We were victims of the night, The chemical, physical, kryptonite Helpless to the bass and faded light Oh we were bound to get together, Bound to get together. She took my arm, I don't know how it happened. We took the floor and she said Oh don't you dare look back Just keep your eyes on me. I said you're holding back, She said shut up and dance with me! This woman is my destiny She said oh oh oh Shut up and dance with me   A backless dress and some beat up sneaks, My discothèque, Juliet teenage dream. I felt it in my chest as she looked at me. I knew we were bound to be together, Bound to be together. She took my arm, I don't know how it happened. We took the floor and she said Oh don't you dare look back Just keep your eyes on me. I said you're holding back, She said shut up and dance with me! This woman is my destiny She said oh oh oh Shut up and dance with me    Deep in her eyes, I think I see the future. I realize this is my last chance. She took my arm, I don't know how it happened. We took the floor and she said Oh d on' t you [G]dare look [C]back Just keep your eyes on me. I said you're holding back, She said shut up and dance with me! This woman is my destiny She said oh oh oh Shut up and dance! Oh don't you dare look back Just keep your eyes on me. I said you're holding back, She said shut up and dance with me! This woman is my destiny She said oh oh oh Shut up and dance with me [G ]O h o h [C]oh shut [Em]up [D]dance with me [G ]O h o h [C]oh shut [Em]up [D]dance with me"
