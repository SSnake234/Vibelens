  "lyrics": "  In the morning, when you wake up I Like to believe you are thinking of me And when the sun comes through your window I like to believe you've been dreaming of me Dreaming , mmm mm I know cause i've spent half this morning Thinking about the tee shirt you sleep in I should know cause i'd spend, Oh the whole day Listening to your message i'm keeping,  And never deleting When I saw you, everyone knew I Liked the affect that you had on my eyes But no one else heard the way of your words or Felt the affect that they have on my mind Falling , mm mmm I know cause i've spent half this morning Thinking about the tee shirt you sleep in I should know cause i'd spend, Oh the whole day Listening to your message i'm keeping,  And never deleting  "
