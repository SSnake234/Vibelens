Cách chơi : Hầu hết chỉ quạt xuống ,hoặc bass 3 21 đan xen quạt ballad nếu thích (tuỳ đoạn) và đoạn nào deep thì móc nhé. (tuỳ đoạn) và đoạn nào deep thì móc nhé.   There’s a laugh in my eyes  There’s a waltz in my walk  And it’s been such a long time  Since there was hope in my talk If you never knew what it is that’s new… it’s you ‘Cause when your hands are in mine  You set a fire that everyone can see And it’s burning away  Every bad memory To tell you the truth If it’s something new… baby it’s you  Ohhhhh.. It’s you in the morning It’s you in the night A beautiful angel came down to light up my life my life The world’s a different place  Where nothing’s too hard to say  And nothing’s too hard to do  Never too much to go through To tell you the truth Everything that’s new…. Baby, It’s you So if I get to grow old  With many years behind me   There’s only one thing I want  One thing I need beside me For all that you are For everything you do For all that you’ve done Just for showing me the truth It’s you It’s you Baby it’s you"
