If you were gone the days  would all be pointless And in the night I'll sing the song so blue A song about spring and every happy moment When I had all the time alone with you. But your right here and nothing could be better So  take my hand and stay with me to dawn And while the wind is playing with your sweater I can't imagine life if you were gone... If you were gone the world would lose it's meaning Without your love how could I smile again And though the sun would always keep on shining I'd never shine without my dearest friend. But your right here and nothing could be better So take my hand and stay with me to dawn And while the wind is playing with your sweater I can't imagine life if you were gone..."
