On the little phone I got you And I know I shouldn't care There are better things to do Then to spend my every moment Creepin' up on you Creepin' up on you Creepin' up on you Creepin', creepin', creepin' Was it all in my head? All in my head All in my head Was it all in my head? All in my head All in my head ... I heard that you've been asking around about me ... I guess you noticed I was on to new things ... Ironic now you check my pictures ... On the little phone I got you Because I thought you didn't care You had better things to see Then to spend a single moment Creepin' up on me Creepin' up on me Creepin' up on me Creepin', creepin', creepin' Was it all in my head? All in my head All in my head Was it all in my head? All in my head All in my head ... It's all in my head ... That you feel this way about me Those are things you never said It was all my fantasy I was just imagining That you thought about me That you thought about me It was all in my head It was all in my head It was all in my head It was all in my head It was all in my head It was all in my head "
