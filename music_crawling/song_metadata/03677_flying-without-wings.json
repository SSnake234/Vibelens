  "lyrics": "Everybody's looking for a some thing One thing that makes it all com plete You'll find it in the strangest places Places you never knew it could be Some find it in the face of their children Some find it in their lover's eyes Who can deny the joy it br ings When you've found that special thing You're flying without wings So, impossi ble as it may see m You've got to fight for every dream Cos who's to know which one you let go Would have made you comp lete"
