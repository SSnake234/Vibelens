Lips that just felt just like the inside o f a rose So how come when I reach out my fingers It feels like more than distance between us In this California king bed We're ten thousand miles apart I bet California wishing on these stars of your heart for me. My Califo rnia king Eye to eye. Cheek to cheek. Side by side. You were sleeping next to me Arm to arm. Dusk to dawn . With the curtains drawn And a little last nite on these sheets So how come when I reach out my fingers It Seems like more than distance between us In this California king bed We're ten thousand miles apart I bet California wishing on these stars of your heart for me My California king. .    Just when I felt like giving up on us You turned around and gave me one last touch That made everything feel better So confused wanna ask you if you love me Maybe I've been California dreaming. In this California king bed We're ten thousand miles apart I bet California wishing on these stars of your heart for me My California king. .  My California king. . In this California king bed We're ten thousand miles apart I bet California wishing on these stars of your heart for me My Califo rnia king"
