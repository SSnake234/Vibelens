  "lyrics": "I'm, I'm good at wasting time I think lyrics need to rhyme But I'm trying to grow a mustache I eat cheese, but only on pizza, please And sometimes on a homemade quesadilla Otherwise it smells like feet to me And I, I really like it when the moon looks like a toenail And I love you when you say my nameeeeeeeee If you wanna know The part of me that'll show if you're close Gonna let you see everything But remember that you asked for it I'll try to do my best to impress But it's easier to let you take a guess at the rest But you wanna hear what lives in my brain My heart, will you ask for it, for your perusing? At times confusing, slightly amusing Introducing me Doo doo, doo doo doo doo to Doo doo, doo doo doo doo to La la la la La la la la la la la la, da I never trust a dog to watch my food And I like to use to the word \"dude\" As a noun, or an adverb, or an adjective And I've never really been into cars I like really cool guitars and superheroes And checks with lots of zeros on 'em I love the sound of violins And making someone smileeeeeee If you wanna know The part of me that'll show if you're close Gonna let you see everything But remember that you asked for it I'll try to do my best to impress But it's easier to let you take a guess at the rest But you wanna hear what lives in my brain My heart, will you ask for it, for your perusing? At times confusing, possibly amusing Introducing me Well, you probably know more than you ever wanted to So be careful when you ask next timeeeeeee So if you wanna know The part of me that'll show if you're close Gonna let you see everything But remember that you asked for it I'll try to do my best to impress But it's easier to let you take a guess at the rest But you wanna hear what lives in my brain My heart, will you ask for it, for your perusing? At times confusing, hopefully amusing Introducing me Doo doo, doo doo doo doo to Doo doo, doo doo doo doo to Doo doo doo doo In tro du cing me"
