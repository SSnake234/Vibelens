  "lyrics": "She was the meanest cat, in old Chicago town, she was the meanest cat, she really mowed them down. She had no heart at all, no no no heart at all. She was the meanest cat, oh she was really tough, she left her husband flat, he wasn't tough enough. She took her boys along, 'cos they were mean and strong. Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - she taught her four sons, Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - to handle their guns. Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - she never could cry, Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - but she knew how to die! They left a trail of crime across the U.S.A. And when one boy was killed, she really made them pay. She had no heart at all, no no no heart at all. Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - she taught her four sons, Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - to handle their guns. Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - she never could cry, Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - but she knew how to die! She met a man she liked, she thought she'd stay with him, one day he fought with them, they did away with him. She didn't care at all, just didn't care at all. One day they robbed a bank, it was their last foray, the cops appeared too soon, they couldn't get away. And all the loot they had, it made them mighty mad. And so they shot it out, Ma Baker and her sons. They didn't want to hang, they died with blazing guns. and so the story ends, of one who left no friends. Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - she taught her four sons, Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - to handle their guns. Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - she never could cry, Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - but she knew how to die. Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - she taught her four sons, Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - to handle their guns. Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - she never could cry, Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - but she knew how to die"
