  "lyrics": " Flashback to the time in your life When thought it would be easy But it’s hard when you’re taking on the world, you know The one shot that you fire at the sky Hoping someone else can see it Just a sign that you’ re not on you own, you know We come one tonight I’v I’v e been waiting for your wake [Eb] up [Bbm]call Growing stronger now I can hear it in a thunderstorm We sing , ohh ohh I don’t want to do this without Ohh ohh I won’t let go now that I’ve found you Now that I’ve found you     ohh ohh I won’t let go now that I’ve found you ohh ohh I won’t let go now that I’ve found you Now that I’ve found you Some say you can’t never go back To the city bed for dreamers But I know we can find it it on, you know The one shot that you fire at the sky But this time we are together We’re right here in this moment where we belong We come one tonight I’ve been waiting for your wake up call Growing stronger now I can hear it in a thunderstorm We sing , ohh ohh I don’t want to do this without Ohh ohh I won’t let go now that I’ve found you Now that I’ve found you     ohh ohh I won’t let go now that I’ve found you ohh ohh I won’t let go now that I’ve found you Now that I’ve found you"
