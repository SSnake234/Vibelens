  "lyrics": "Be fore you came I’ve been lost and all alone but still no body knew Watching days all passing by, still here just on my own Just letting time slip away Waiting for someone to hear The voice wi thin my soul Just like the sun, When you walked into my life You eased the pain away Lighting up the dark and brin ging color to my life That moment when I feel our love You are the one that I’ve been dreaming of I’ll be here by your side Keeping you warm in my arms Loving you till I die Just put your hand in mine Listen to my heartbeat You’ll feel the love just for you Every thing turns bright when you smile Cuz you’ll always be the sunshine… in my heart Here comes the dawn I won’t have to walk alone Cuz you’re now here with me It was just the dream I dreamed until you make it real That moment when we share our love You are the one I cherish all my life"
