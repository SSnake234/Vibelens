I love you And everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai- aight Be alright, ai-ai-ai- aight Through the long nights and the bright lights Don't you worry 'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai- aight Be alright, ai-ai-ai- aight And you know that I care for you I'll always be there for you I promise I will stay right here I know that you want me too Baby we can make it through anything 'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai- aight Be alright, ai-ai-ai- aight Through the sorrow, and the fights Don't you worry 'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai- aight Be alright, ai-ai-ai- aight Through the sorrow, and the fights Don't you worry Everything's gonna be alri-ai-ai-aight"
