  "lyrics": " I threw a wish in the well, Don't ask me, I'll never tell I looked to you as it fell, and now you're in my way I trade my soul for a wish, pennies and dimes for a kiss I wasn't looking for this, but now you're in my way Your stare was holdin', Ripped jeans, skin was showin' Hot night, wind was blowin' Where you think you're going, baby? Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy , but here's my number, so call me, maybe? It's hard to look right, at you baby, but here's my number, so call me, maybe? Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy , but here's my number, so call me, maybe? It's hard to look right, at you baby, but here's my number, so call me, maybe? You took your time with the call, I took no time with the fall You gave me nothing at all, but still, you're in my way I beg, and borrow and steal Have foresight and it's real I didn't know I would feel it, but it's in my way Your stare was holdin', Ripped jeans, skin was showin' Hot night, wind was blowin' Where you think you're going, baby? Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy , but here's my number, so call me, maybe? It's hard to look right, at you baby, but here's my number, so call me, maybe? Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy , but here's my number, so call me, maybe? It's hard to look right, at you baby, but here's my number, so call me, maybe? my life I missed you so bad I missed you so bad I missed you so, so bad my life I missed you so bad I missed you so bad I missed you so, so bad"
