Oh can you love me like Can you love me like Oh can you love me like Can you love me like I’ll just keep repeating that in case you didin’t catch me Oh can you love me like Can you love me like Sunshine left today Got caught in the rain all alone Can you come and pick me up from my blues or am I late to ask you Love me soft and tender Oh can you love me like Can you love me like Oh can you love me like Can you love me like I’ll just keep repeating that in case you didin’t catch me Oh can you love me like Can You love me like Oh can you love me like Can you love me like Oh can you love me like Can you love me like I’ll just keep repeating that in case you didin’t catch me Oh can you love me like Can you love me like I’ll just keep repeating that in case you didin’t catch me Oh can You love me like Can you love me like"
