  "lyrics": "... I know you moved onto someone new ... Hope life is beautiful ... You were the life of me to find my truth I just wanna say, thank you ... Leaving to find my soul Told her I had to go And I know it ain't pretty When two hearts get broke Too young to feel this old Watching us both turn cold And I know it ain't pretty When two hearts get broke Yeah, I know it ain't pretty When two hearts get broke ... I hope someday We'll ... sit down together ... And laugh with each other About these days, these days ... All our troubles ... We'll lay to rest And we'll wish we could come back to These days, these days   These days, these days   These days, these days Three years of ups and downs Nothing to show for it now And I know it ain't pretty when the fire burns out Calling me when I'm drunk Reminding me of what I've done And I know it ain't pretty when you're trying to move on ... I hope someday We'll ... sit down together ... And laugh with each other About these days, these days ... All our troubles ... We'll lay to rest And we'll wish we could come back to These days, these days   These days, these days   These days, these days ... Cigarettes and the ash tray ... Reminiscing on those past days ... I thought you didn't know my last name But ... that changed And I travelled around the world Think where you living at now? I heard you moved to Oxford Got a new apartment and settled down ... And every once in a while Write a paragraph But then I delete the message ... Think 'bout you like a past time I could cry you a river ... ... I wasn't ready to act right Used to always think I'd get you back, right ... They say that things fall apart We were gonna move to Brooklyn Love is just a tool And that we are not alone ... I hope someday We'll ... sit down together ... And laugh with each other About these days, these days ... All our troubles ... We'll lay to rest And we'll wish we could come back to These days, these days And we'll wish we could come back to These days, these days"
