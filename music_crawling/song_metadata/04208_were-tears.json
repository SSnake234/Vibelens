  "lyrics": " I've been there before just to feel the pain and Fear inside of You ... Don't you know how hard that I've tried to hide, to run We still can not find the way and don't want to let it go Let me feel your touch then I'm alive Long long way to run Oh baby let me cry with you When the world getting darker and being so Cold You know you're not alone... When the Time rolling down with Tears... To wash away the Lies... When the moon meets the Sun in my Sky.. i know you're still the one And I'm Falling with you You know that we are Tears..."
