  "lyrics": "  When you get older, plainer, saner Will you remember all the danger we came from Burning like embers, falling, tender Longing for the days of no surrender Years ago And well you know Smoke them if you got them 'Cause it's going down All I ever wanted was you I'll never get to heaven 'Cause I don't know how Let's raise a glass or two To all the things I lost on you Oh oh Tell me are they lost on you? Oh oh Just that you could cut me loose Oh oh After everything I've lost on you Is that lost on you? Oooooh oooh Oooooh Is that lost on you? Oooooh oooh Baby is that lost on you? Is that lost on you? Wishing I could see the machinations Understand the toil of expectations in your mind Hold me like you never lost your patience Tell me that you love me more than hate me all the time And you're still mine So smoke 'em if you've got 'em 'Cause it's going down All I ever wanted was you Let's take a drink of ever lisk And turn around Let's raise a glass or two To all the things I've lost on you Oh oh Tell me are they lost on you? Oh oh Just that you could cut me loose Oh oh After everything I've lost on you Is that lost on you? Oooooh oooh Oooooh Is that lost on you? Oooooh oooh Baby is that lost on you? Is that lost on you? Lost on you oohoahoah  Let's raise a glass or two To all the things I've lost on you Oh oh Tell me are they lost on you? Oh oh Just that you could cut me loose Oh oh After everything I've lost on you Is that lost on you? oooh ooh oooooh oooh"
