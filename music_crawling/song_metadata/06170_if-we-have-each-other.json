  "lyrics": "She was 19 with a baby on the way On the East-side of the city, she was working every day She was clinging to the feeling that her luck was gonna change And, across town she'd take the bus at night to a one bedroom apartment She was waiting on the day that she hoped her baby would arrive She'd never be alone Have someone to hold And when nights were cold, she'd say The world's not perfect but it's not that bad If we got each other and that's all we have I will be your mother and I'll hold your hand You should know I'll be there for you And the world's not perfect when the world's not kind If we have each other then we'll both be fine I will be your mother and I'll hold your hand You should know I'll be there for you They were 90 and were living out their days On the West-side of the city next to where they got engaged And their life was never easy they were thankful that they stayed With each other and though some times were hard Even when she made him angry he would never break her heart But they never had to travel 'cause they'd never be apart Even at the end, their love was stronger then the day that they first met They'd say The world's not perfect but it's not that bad If we got each other and that's all we have I will be your mother and I'll hold your hand You should know I'll be there for you And the world's not perfect when the world's not kind If we have each other then we'll both be fine I will be your mother and I'll hold your hand You should know I'll be there for you  You should know I'll be there for you I'm 23 and my folks are getting old I know they don't have forever and I'm scared to be alone So I'm thankful for my sister even though sometimes we fight When high school wasn't easy, she's the reason I survived I know she'd never leave me and I hate to see her cry So I wrote this verse to tell her that I'm always by her side I wrote this verse to tell her that I'm always by her side I wrote this verse to tell her that The world's not perfect but it's not that bad If we got each other and that's all we have I will be your mother and I'll hold your hand You should know I'll be there for you And the world's not perfect when the world's not kind If we have each other then we'll both be fine I will be your mother and I'll hold your hand You should know I'll be there for you  You should know I'll be there for you"
