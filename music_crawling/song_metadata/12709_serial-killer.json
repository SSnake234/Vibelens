If I lay really quiet, I know that what I do isn't right, I can't stop what I love to do. So I murder love in the night, Wat ching them fall one by one they fight , Do you think you'll love me too? Baby I'm a sociopath On the warpath Cause I love you just a little too much I love you just a little too much You can see me drinking Cherry Cola I left a love note Said you know I love the thrill of the rush You know I love the thrill of the rush (You send me right to heaven) (I guess I'll see him over) Do it for the thrill of the rush Love you just a little too much, much (You send me right to heaven) (I guess I'll see him over) I love you just a little too much Love you just a little too much, much My black fire's burning bright Maybe I'll go out tonight We can paint the town in blue I'm so hot, I ignite Dancing in the dark and I shine Like a light I'm luring you Sneak up on you really quiet Whisper, \"Am I what your heart desires?\" I can be your inge nue Keep you safe and inspired Baby, let your fantasies unwind We can do what you want to do Baby I'm a sociopath On the warpath Cause I love you just a little too much I love you just a little too much You can see me drinking Cherry Cola I left a love note Said you know I love the thrill of the rush You know I love the thrill of the rush (You send me right to heaven) (I guess I'll see him over) Do it for the thrill of the rush Love you just a little too much, much (You send me right to heaven) (I guess I'll see him over) I love you just a little too much Love you just a little too much, much Just have fun I don't want one La-la, la-la, la, la-la, la-la, lie down, down Baby I'm a sociopath On the warpath Cause I love you just a little too much I love you just a little too much You can see me drinking Cherry Cola I left a love note Said you know I love the thrill of the rush You know I love the thrill of the rush (You send me right to heaven) (I guess I'll see him over) Do it for the thrill of the rush Love you just a little too much, much (You send me right to heaven) (I guess I'll see him over) I love you just a little too much Love you just a little too much, much"
