  "lyrics": "Why does the sun go on shining Why does the sea rush to shore Don't they know it's the end of the world 'Cause you don't love me anymore ... Why do the birds go on singing Why do the stars glow above Don't they know it's the end of the world It ended when I lost your love I wake up in the morning and I wonder Why everythings the same as it was I can't understand, no I can't understand How life goes on the way it does Why does my heart go on beating Why do these eyes of mine cry Don't they know it's the end of the world It ended when you said goodbye ..."
