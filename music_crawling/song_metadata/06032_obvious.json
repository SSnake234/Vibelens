  "lyrics": "      You don't ever notice when I’m turning on my charm Or wonder why I'm always where you are I've made it obvious Done everything but sing it (I've crushed on you so long, but on and on you get me wrong) I'm not so good with words And since you never notice The way that we belong I'll say it in a love song How you want someone just like me (Bryan echo: just like me) (I've crushed on you so long but on and on you get me wrong) You are my very first thought in the morning And my last at nightfall You are the love that came without warning I need you, I want you to know  The love song I`m sing it until the day you're holding me I've wanted you so long but on and on you get me wrong I more than adore you but since you never seem to see Since you never seem to see I'll say it in this love song"
