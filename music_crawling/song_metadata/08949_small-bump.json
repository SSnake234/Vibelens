  "lyrics": "Your just a small bump unborn and in 4 months your brought to life might be left with my hair but you will have your mother's eyes Hold your body in my hands I will be as gentle as I can now your scans and unmade plan A small bump, In 4 months your brought to life I will hold you tightly, I will give you nothing but truth If your not inside me I will put my future in you Cos you are my one, and only You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight Cos you are my one, and only You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight You will be alright Your just a small bump unknown and you'll grow into your skin With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice and eyelids closed to be soon opened wide A small bump, in 4 months you will open your eyes I will hold you tightly, I will give you nothing but truth If your not inside me I will put my future in you Cos you are my one, and only You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight Cos you are my one, and only You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight You will be alright You can lie with me, with your tiny feet when your half asleep, I will leave you be Right in front of me for a couple weeks So I can keep you safe Cos you are my one, and only You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight Cos you are my one, and only You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight You will be alright Your just a small bump unborn just four months then torn from life Maybe your needed up there but were still un-aware of why"
