Do what you want to Girl, put your records on, Tell me your favorite song You go ahead, let your hair down Sapphire and faded jeans I hope you get your dreams Just go ahead, let your hair down Girl, put your records on, Tell me your favorite song You go ahead, let your hair down Sapphire and faded jeans I hope you get your dreams Just go ahead, let your hair down Ooo, You're gonna find yourself somewhere, Some how."
