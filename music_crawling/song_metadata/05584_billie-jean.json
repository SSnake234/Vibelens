  "lyrics": "She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene I said don`t mind but what do you mean,I am the one Who will dance on the floor in the round She said I am the one Who will dance on the floor in the round ? She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene. Of being the one, Who will dance on the floor in the round People always told me, be careful what you do. And don`t go around breaking young girls' hearts And mother always told me, be careful who you love, And be careful what you do, `cause the lie becomes the truth, hey Billie Jean is not my lover, She's just a girl who claims that I am the one But the kid is not my son She says I am the one, But the kid is not my son For forty days and forty nights, law was on her side Her scemes and plans `Cause we danced on the floor in the round. She told my baby we danced till three, and she looked at me, His eyes were like mine. Can we dance on the floor in the round ? People always told me, be careful what you do. And don`t go around breaking young girls' hearts. But you came and stood right by me, just a smell of sweet perfume. This happened much too soon. She called me to her room, hey Billie Jean is not my lover, She's just a girl who claims that I am the one But the kid is not my son She says I am the one, But the kid is not my son Billie Jean is not my lover, She's just a girl who claims that I am the one But the kid is not my son She says I am the one, But the kid is not my son Billie Jean is not my lover, Billie Jean is not my lover, Billie Jean is not my lover, Billie Jean is not my lover."
