  "lyrics": "tone Saturday morning jumped out of bed and put on my best suit Got in my car and raced like a jet, all the way to you Knocked on your door with heart in my hand To ask you a question Cause I know that you're an old fashioned man yeah yeah Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life? say yes, say yes, Cause I need to know You say I'll never get your blessings till the day I die Tough luck my friend but the answer is no! Why you gotta be so rude? , Don't you know I'm human too why you gotta be so rude I'm gonna marry her anyway marry that girl, marry her anyway marry that girl yeah no matter what you say marry that girl and we'll be a family Why you gotta be so rude  I hate to do this, you leave no choice I can't live without her Love me or hate me we will be boys Standing at that alter or we will run away to another galaxy you know You know she's in love with me She will go anywhere I go"
