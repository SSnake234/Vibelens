My words of love with your name on every wall. When you leave my colors fade to grey. Ooa ooa eh, Ooa ooa ooa eh. Every-one all over used to say. Now I think it every day. When you leave my colors fade to grey. A little stay or my colors fade away. Every-one all over used to say. Now I think it every day. Mia He Mia Ho Mia Ha Mia Ha Ha. (x3) I saw my strengths my song and dreams. And I bought some things to match the color of my love. Hello hello its me again...Picasso. I will spray. My words of love with your name on every wall. Mia He Mia Ho Mia Ha Mia Ha Ha. (x3)"
