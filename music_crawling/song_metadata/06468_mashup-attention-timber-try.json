  "lyrics": "You've been runnin' round, runnin' round, runnin' round throwin' that dirt all on my name. 'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd call you up. You've been going round, going round, going round every party in LA 'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd be at one You just want attention You don't want my heart Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new Yeah, you just want attention I knew from the start You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you It's going down, I'm yelling timber You better move, you better dance Let's make a night, you won't remember I'll be the one, you won't forget You don't have to try so hard You don't have to, give it all away You just have to get up, get up, get up, get up You don't have to change a single thing You don't have to try, try, try, try You don't have to try, try, try, try You don't have to try, try, try, try You don't have to try Yooou don't have to try Oooh, oooh"
