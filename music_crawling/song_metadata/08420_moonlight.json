  "lyrics": " I bought you things that I didn't even have the money for If I could make you feel so rich, I don't mind feeling poor There's something about you so addictive, had me needing more Yeah, I just wanna hold you I know I've said this all before but I'll say it again You the only one I want and girl, I can't pretend I remember cloudy days we cuddled in my bed The thought of losing you just makes no sense inside my head You the reason I believe that love is real Ain't nobody make me feel the way you make me feel Darling, tell me is it real? Or was I lying to myself just to make it feel so real? Ain't nobody gon' love you like I love you Ain't nobody gon' want you like I want you Ain't nobody gon' trust you like I trust you Ain't nobody gon ' ain't nobody gon' Ain't nobody gon' love you like I love you Ain't nobody gon' trust you like I trust you Ain't nobody gon' want you like I want you Ain't nobody gon' wanna no no no I can't love nobody anymore You the only one that I ever want I compare her to you, she has never won Now I wanna just be all alone Nobody love me like you You remind me of the moon Cuz' every night you coming back What am I supposed to do? I cannot get over you I cannot get over you Since you left me every night I go stare at the moon Wishing it was you and I that's something we would do Every Sunday morning I go watch the flowers bloom I do things we used to do hoping I'll run into you What's a lie and what's the truth I cannot get over you Everyone just looks like you Smell your perfume and your hair Everyone knows that I care You the reason I believe that love is real Ain't nobody make me feel the way you make me feel Darling, tell me is it real? Or was I lying to myself just to make it feel so real?"
