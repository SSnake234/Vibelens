  "lyrics": "tone Outlines of your eyes and visions of you Girl, I think I need a minute To figure out what is, what isn't These choices and voices, they're all in my head Sometimes, you make me feel crazy Sometimes, I swear I think you hate me like, Uh, I need a walk, I need a walk I need to get out of here 'Cause I need to know Who are you? 'Cause you're not the girl I fell in love with, baby Who are you? 'Cause somethin' has changed, you're not the same, I hate it I, I'm sick of waitin' for love, love I, I know that you're not the one, one Feelin' hypnotized by the words that you said Don't lie to me, just get in my head When the mornin' comes, you're still in my bed But it's so , so cold Who are you? 'Cause you're not the girl I fell in love with Who are you? 'Cause you're not the girl I fell in love with, baby Who are you? 'Cause somethin' has changed, you're not the same, I hate it I, I'm sick of waitin' for love, love I, I know that you're not the one, one"
