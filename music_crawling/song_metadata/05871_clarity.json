  "lyrics": "High dive into frozen waves where the past comes back to life Fight fear for the selfish pain And it's worth it every time Hold still right before we crash Cause we both know how this ends our clock ticks till it breaks your glass And I drown in you again Cause you are the piece of me I wish I didn't need Chasing relentlessly Still fight and I don't know why If our love is tragedy why are you my remedy If our love's insanity why are you my clarity wa lk on t hro ugh a red parade"
