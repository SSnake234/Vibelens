I be lieve it's meant to be, darling I watch you when you are sleeping you belong with me Do you feel the same? Am I only drea ming? Is this burning an eternal flame? Say my name Sun shines through the rain A whole life so lonely and then come and ease the pain I don't want to lose this feeling, oh Say my name Sun shines through the rain A whole life so lonely and then come and ease the pain I don't want to lose this feeling, oh Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling Do you feel my heart beating? Do you under stand? Do you feel the same? Am I only drea ming? Is this burning an eternal flame? Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling Do you feel my heart beating? Do you under stand? Do you feel the same? Am I only drea ming? Is this burning an eternal flame? Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling Do you feel my heart beating? Do you under stand? Do you feel the same? Am I only drea ming? Is this burning an eternal flame?"
