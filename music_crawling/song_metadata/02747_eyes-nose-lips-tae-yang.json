  "lyrics": "You left me paralyzed. No cure. No rehab for me. Funny that you got the nerve to keep askin' me how I've been. You're the victor in this pageantry. But the only trophy you deserve... Catastrophe. I'd rather we be dead to each other. No eulogles said for each other. No rest in peace's. The memories got my chest in pieces Because your eyes, nose, lips Every look and every breath Every kiss still got me dying Uh, still got me crying"
