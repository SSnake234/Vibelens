I wish I could carry your smile and my heart. For times when my life seems so low. It would make me believe what to- morrow could bring. When to- day doesn't really know, doesn't really know... I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you. I know you were right be- lieving for so long. I'm all out of love, what am I without you. I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong... I want you to come back and carry me home. A- way from this long lonely nights. I'm reaching for you, are you feeling it too. Does the feeling seem oh so right . And what would you say if I called on you now. And said that I can't hold on. There's no easy way, it gets harder each day. Please love me or I'll be gone, I'll be gone. I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you. I know you were right be- lieving for so long. I'm all out of love, what am I without you. I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong  . Oh, what are you thinking of  ? What are you thinking of . Oh, what are you thinking of  ? What are you thinking of? I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you. I know you were right be- lieving for so long. I'm all out of love, what am I without you. I can't be too late I know that I was so wrong..."
