  "lyrics": "I don't wanna be lonely When winter is freezing And trees start to bald And I don't wanna be sitting Alone in a room That's just filled with my soul So I came to this place Looking for a familiar face And that's when I saw you 'Cause you don't know me and I don't know you But it breaks my heart you looking so blue On the last of the year I just peeked your name on the coffee cup What a stroke of luck the guy just messed up And gave your cup to me So we're swapping our cups And after a while We're swapping a glance I can think nothing better Than starting the year with a drop of romance 'Cause I came to this place Looking for a familiar face And that's when I met you 'Cause you don't know me and I don't know you it breaks my heart you looking so blue On the first of the year I just peeked your name on the coffee cup What a stroke of luck the guy just messed up And gave your cup to me A dark cappuccino is what made us meet The way you came toward me dragging you feet And I just smiled at you"
