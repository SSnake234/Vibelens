  "lyrics": "Tell me how much more do I have to lose Before I can ever forgive myself Do you know how much more pain I must endure Before I can ever see your face again One more time　-　Tell me why the seasons keep on changing One more time　-　Missing all the times that we shared as one It doesn’t matter where I am because I can’t help but look for you everywhere On the station platform, in the alley windows I keep fooling myself thinking I might find you there Never thought I would wish upon a star I just want to be there by your side There’s nothing that I won’t do, I’d give up everything Just to hold you in my arms, one more time Memories of our summers together ooh Our beating hearts were heard no more"
