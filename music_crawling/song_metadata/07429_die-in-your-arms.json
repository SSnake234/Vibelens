If this is a lesson Baby teach me to behave Just tell me what I gotta do If I could just die in your arms ‘Cause everytime you touch me I just die in your arms Oh but it feels so right Loving you is so damn easy for me Tell me baby I’m all that you need If I could just die in your arms ‘Cause everytime you touch me I just die in your arms Oh but it feels so right   "
