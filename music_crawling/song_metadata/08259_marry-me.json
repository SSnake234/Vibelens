Oh yeah How many girls in the world can make me feel like this? Baby I don't ever plan to find out The more I look, the more I find the reasons why You're the love of my life And you know one of these days when I get my money right Buy you everything and show you all the finer things in life We'll forever be in love, so there ain't no need to rush But one day, I won't be able to ask you loud enough I'll say will you marry me I swear that I will mean it I'll say will you marry me And if I lost everything In my heart it means nothing 'Cause I have you, girl I have you So get right down on bended knee Nothing else would ever be Better, better The day when I say I'll say will you marry me I swear that I will mean it I'll say will you marry me I'll say will you marry me I swear that I will mean it I'll say will you marry me Got me singing Oooh-oh Oooh-oh Oh Oooh-oh Oooh-oh Oh Oooh-oh Oooh-oh Oh.. Oooh-oh Oooh-oh Oh Oooh-oh Oooh-oh Oh Oooh-oh Oooh-oh Oh.. 105 is the number that comes to my head When I think of all the years I wanna be with you Wake up every morning with you in my bed That's precisely what I plan to do"
