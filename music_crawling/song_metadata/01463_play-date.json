  "lyrics": "   (x2) You call me on the telephone, you feel so far away You tell me to come over there’s some games you want to play I'm walking to your house, nobody's home Just me and you, you and me alone We're just playing hide and seek It's getting hard to breathe un der the sheets with you I don't wanna play no games, I'm tired of always chasing, chasing after you I don't give a fuck about you any ways Who ever said I gave a shit 'bout you? You never share your toys or com muni cate I guess I'm just a play date to you    (x2) Wake up in your bedroom and there's nothing left to say When I try to talk you're always playing board games I wish I had monopoly over your mind I wish I didn't care all the time We're just playing hide and seek It's getting hard to breathe un der the sheets with you I don't wanna play no games, I'm tired of always chasing, chasing after you I don't give a fuck about you any ways Who ever said I gave a shit 'bout you? You never share your toys or com muni cate I guess I'm just a play date to you    (x2) Ring around the rosy I never know, I never know what you need Ring around the rosy, I want to give you, want to give you I don't give a fuck about you any ways Who ever said I gave a shit 'bout you? You never share your toys or com muni cate I guess I'm just a play date to you You know I give a fuck about you every day Guess it's time that I tell you the truth If I share my toys, will you let me stay? Don't want to leave this play date with you"
