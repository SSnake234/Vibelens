Follow him wherever he may go..there isn't an ocean too deep, a mountain so high it can keep, keep me away.  I will follow him. Ever since he touched my hand I knew, that near him I always must be..and nothing can keep him from me.. he is my destiny.  I love him, I love him, I love him... and where he goes I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow... He'll always be my true love, my true love, my true love, from now until forever, forever, forever... I will follow him. Follow him wherever he may go..there isn't an ocean too deep, a mountain so high it can keep, keep me a way.. a.. way from my love. I love him, I love him, I love him... and where he goes I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow... He'll always be my true love, my true love, my true love, from now until for ever, forever, forever... I love him, I love him, I love him... and where he goes I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow... He'll always be my true love, my true love, my true love, from now until for ever, forever, forever... I love him, I love him, I love him... And where he goes I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow. I know I'll always love him, I love him, I love him. And where he goes I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow..."
