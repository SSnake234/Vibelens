  "lyrics": "Through the endless daydream I saw you on the way back There I walked with you in my arms - Through the blurry darkness Who’s veiling on the twilight We’ve been far away from my fears - Somewhere else I’ll see you Our days be like a blossom Blooming all around you so bright - By and by I’ll miss you And your laugh like a sunshine Fading into shadow of tears All around me is your light With you everything so shines How come we’ll leave all behind Cause your love is falling on my heart And I’m falling for you Falling with broken wings again - Hush! now my angel I will always be with you - In your pretty smile, in a glow of tears Out across the frosty night I’ll be there with you Maybe someday you’ll wake up alone without me - But don’t cry again, I’ll be waiting here Where the moon is on the rise, as the olden days -  - - -  I could just go with you between our time ...Where they can’t find us somehow You could just come away, with me out there ...Where we could dream away, all day Hush! now my angel I will always be with you - In your pretty smile, in a glow of tears Out across the frosty night, I’ll be there with you Maybe you’ll always breath in me ever in my heart - All the little pieces of you, look how they shine above - Come away with me tonight We’ll be dreaming away there - Maybe you’ll always breath in me ever in my heart - All the little pieces of you, look how they shine above Come away with me tonight We’ll be dreaming away there"
