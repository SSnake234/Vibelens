  "lyrics": "Tone We could drive a long an ocean re flecting the sun Or make a bed of green atop a wide open scene Under a canvas of blue I would draw ever nearer to you To feel the dew on your skin that is how it would be gin For summer is for falling in love We could stay out late until the sun sets past eight And the cotton candy haze mirrors the warmth of your gaze Raise your glass to mine and as we drink, we would lock eyes So we could disre gard the thought of ever having to part For summer is for falling in love This lightness of being we both know to be fleeting Like the last breath of a sunset right be fore the day is dead But maybe the heat of today could keep even winter a way So I'll remember your laugh 'Cause nothing ever changes the fact That summer is for falling in love Summer is for falling in love"
