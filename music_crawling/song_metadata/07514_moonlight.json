Remember last year when you told me To always stay here and never leave me The light from your eyes made it feel like We-e-e-e were dancing in the moonlight Remember last year when you told me That these will be lifelong stories The light from your eyes made it feel like We-e-e-e were dancing in the moonlight ( Ooh-ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh - ooh - ooh) ( Ooh-ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh - ooh - ooh) I, I, I, miss those memories We used to share just you and me Remember last year when you told me To always stay here and never leave me The light from your eyes made it feel like We-e-e-e were dancing in the moonlight Remember last year when you told me That these will be lifelong stories The light from your eyes made it feel like We-e-e-e were dancing in the moonlight Ooh-ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh - ooh - ooh The light from your eyes made it feel like Dancing in the moonlight"
