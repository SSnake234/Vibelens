Cause I don't know, how to make the feeling stop. Just so you know This feeling's taking control of me, and I can't help it. I won't sit around, I can't let him win now. Thought you should know, I tried my best to let go of you, but I don't want too. I just gotta say it all before I go. It's getting hard to, be around you. There's so much I can't say. Do you want me to have the feelings? And look the other way. And I don't know, how to be fine when I'm not. Cause I don't know, how to make the feeling stop. Just so you know This feeling's taking control of me, and I can't help it. I won't sit around, I can't let him win now. Thought you should know, I tried my best to let go of you, but I don't want too. I just gotta say it all before I go. This emptiness is killing me I'm wondering why I've waited so long Looking back I realize, it was always there, just never spoken I'm waiting here Been waiting here Cho ru s:   Just so you know This feeling's taking control of me, and I can't help it.
