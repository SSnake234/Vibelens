  "lyrics": " Bum bum be-dum bum bum be-dum bum No more gas in the rig Can't even get it started Not hing heard, nothing said Can't even speak about it All my life on my head Don't want to think about it Feels like I'm going insane Ye- ah It's a thief in the night. To come and grab you It can creep up inside you And consume you A disease of the mind. It can control you It's too close for comfort."
