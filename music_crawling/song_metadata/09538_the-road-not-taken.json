  "lyrics": "Two roads diverged in a yellow wood But here I lay now, sick and so confused Was it a lie or was it all true Sleep now gently my darling love Don\"t let my worries trouble you People try hard to forget But memories always stay Nightmares and dreams of long passed things Try and chase me a- way from sleep All that time I spent in the dark Just like that; I\"m in the light Everything will be fine La la la la la la la la la la la la …. la la la Notice all the similarities Just imagine what all could have happened Every one I knew would long be dead What really goes on behind closed doors Makes me secretly cry out loud Within all these horror stories Lay many times of regret Always in such a frightened state Trapped in an ima- ginary cage Living life day by day And soon enough; some day I\"ll come out and play In a world where everything is upside down I try hard not to lose my mind I want to grow up and be a real bad cop In the end, it\"ll work"
