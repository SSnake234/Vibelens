La-la how the life goes on Ob-la-di ob-la-da life goes on, bra! La-la how the life goes on Desmond takes a trolley to the jewellers stores Buys a twenty carat golden ring (Golden ring?) Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door And as he gives it to her she begins to sing (Sing) In a couple of years they have built a home sweet home With a couple of kids running in the yard Of Desmond and Molly Jones (Ah ha ha ha ha ha) Happy ever after in the market place Desmond lets the children lend a hand (Arm! Leg!) Molly stays at home and does her pretty face And in the evening she still sings it with the band Yeah, happy ever after in the market place Molly lets the children lend a hand (Foot!) Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face And in the evening she's a singer with the band And if ya want some fun, Sing Ob-la-di, Bla-da!"
