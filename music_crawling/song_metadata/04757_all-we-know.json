  "lyrics": "   Fighting flames of fire Hang onto burning wires We don’t care any more Are we fading lovers? We keep wasting colors Maybe we should let this go We’re falling apart, still we hold together We’ve passed the end, so we chase forever ’Cause this is all we know This feeling’s all we know I’ll ride my bike up to the world Down the streets right through the city I’ll go everywhere you go From Chi cago to the coast You tell me, “ Hit this and let’s go Blow the smoke right through the window” ’Cause this is all we know  Cause this is all we know  Cause this is all we know Never face each other One but different covers We don’t care any more Two hearts still beating On with different rhythms Maybe we should let this go We’re falling apart, still we hold together We’ve passed the end, so we chase forever ’Cause this is all we know This feeling’s all we know I’ll ride my bike up to the world Down the streets right through the city I’ll go everywhere you go From Chi cago to the coast You tell me, “ Hit this and let’s go Blow the smoke right through the window” ’Cause this is all we know  Cause this is all we know  Cause this is all we know  "
