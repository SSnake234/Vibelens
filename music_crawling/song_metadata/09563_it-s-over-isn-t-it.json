( ) Isn't it? Isn't it over? It's over, isn't it? ( ) Isn't it? Isn't it over? You won and she chose you and she loved you and she's gone It's over, isn't it? Why can't I move on? War and glory, re invention Fusion, freedom, her attention Out in daylight, my potential Bold, precise, ex perimental Who am I now in this world without her? Petty and dull with the nerve to doubt her What does it matter? It's already done Now I've got to be there for her son It's over, isn't it? ( ) Isn't it? Isn't it over? It's over, isn't it? ( ) Isn't it? Isn't it over? You won and she chose you and she loved you and she's gone It's over, isn't it? Why can't I move on? It's over, isn't it? Why can't I move on?"
