All these plac-es had__their__ moments, With lovers and friends _ I still re-call. Some are dead_and_some_are _ iving, In my__life I've loved them all. - ----- But of all these friends and lov-ers, There is no__one com pares with you. - And these mem'-ries lose their meaning, When I think of__ love as some-thing new. Tho' I know__I'll__nev-er lose af- fection For people and things_that went be-fore, I know I'll of-ten stop and think a- bout them. In My__Life I love you more.     (Coda)     - ---- In My__Life I love you more"
