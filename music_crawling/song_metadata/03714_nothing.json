  "lyrics": "Tracksuits and red wine movies for two We'll take off our phones and we'll turn off our shoes We'll play nintendo though I always lose Cause you watch the TV while I'm watching you There's not many people I'd honestly say I don't mind losing to But there's nothing like doing nothing With you Dumb conversation we lose track of time Have I told you lately I'm grateful you're mine We'll watch the notebook for the 17th time I'll say It's stupid then you catch me crying We're not making out on a boat in the rain Or in a house I painted blue But there's nothing like doing nothing With you  So shut all the windows lock all the doors We're not looking for no one don't need nothing more You'll bite my lip and i'll want you more Until we end up in a heap on the floor   You could be dancing on table tops wearing high heels Drinking until the world spins like a wheel But tonight your apartment has so much appeal Who needs stars? We've got a roof And there's nothing like doing nothing With you  No there's nothing like doing nothing With you"
