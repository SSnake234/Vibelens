To tell the truth you kn ow I have been hurting all along, Someway let me know, you want me gi rl. (Same chord Progression  . You make me wanna call you in the middle of the night. You make me wanna hold you till the morning light. You make me wanna love, you make me wanna fall. You make me wanna surrender my soul. I know this is a feeling that I just can't fight. You're the first and last thing on my mind. You make me wanna love, you make me wanna fall. You make me wanna surrender my soul. (Same Chord Progression  ) I'll take you home real quick And sit you down on the couch Pour some Dom Perignon and hit the lights out. Baby we can make sweet love, wooh. Then we'll take it nice and slow. I'm gonna touch you like you've never known before We're gonna make love, oooh!"
