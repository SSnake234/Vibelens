  "lyrics": "Share my life, take me for what I am 'Cause I'll never change all my co lours for you Take my love, I'll never ask for too much Just all that you are and everything that you do I don't really need to look very much further I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow I won't hold it back again, this passion in side Can't run from myself There's no where to hide Don't make me close one more door I don't wanna hurt any more Stay in my arms if you dare Or must I i magine you there Don't walk a way from me... I have nothing, not hing, not hing If I don't have you.  .  You see through right to the heart of me You break down my walls with the strength of your love I never knew love like I've known it with you Will a memory survive, one I can hold on to I don't really need to look very much further I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow I won't hold it back again, this passion in side Can't run from myself There's no where to hide Your love I'll re member for ever Don't make me close one more door I don't wanna hurt any more Stay in my arms if you dare Or must I i magine you there Don't walk a way from me... I have nothing, nothing, nothing Don't make me close one more door I don't wanna hurt any more Stay in my arms if you dare Or must I i magine you there Don't walk a way from me, no. Don't walk a way from me, don't you dare Don't you dare walk a way from m e I have nothing, not hing, not hing If I don't have you."
