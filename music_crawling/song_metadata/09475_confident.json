  "lyrics": " It's time for me to take it, I'm the boss right now Not gonna fake it, not when you go down Cause this is my game and you better come to play I used to hold my freak back, now I'm letting go I make my own choice, yes I run the show So leave the lights on, no you can't make me behave So you say I'm complicated, that I must be out my mind But you've had me underated What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being What's wrong with being confident? oh oh oh What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being What's wrong with being confident? oh oh oh It's time to get the chains out, is your tongue tied up Cause this is my ground and I'm dangerous And you can get off but it's all 'bout me tonight So you say I'm complicated, that I must be out my mind But you've had me underated What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being What's wrong with being confident? oh oh oh What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being What's wrong with being confident? oh oh oh  So you say I'm complicated but you've had me underated What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being What's wrong with being confident? oh oh oh What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being What's wrong with being confident? oh oh oh"
