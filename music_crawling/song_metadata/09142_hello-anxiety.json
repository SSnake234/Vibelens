  "lyrics": "Hel lo, Anxiety. You've come to keep me company. To night, a lonely soul. I've tried to learn the art of letting go. I'm craving something real, a kind of rush that I can feel. The night is rough you know, I've cried but I won't dare to let it show. What if the world won't bend my way? What will it take to be happy? Heaven knows you're lost but you'll be fine, you'll be fine. Heaven knows we're lost but the sun still shines, we'll be fine. Hel lo, Anxiety. It's time we part, I need to sleep. I'm fine with counting sheep. ...You'll be fine. ...You'll be fine. ...You'll be fine. ...You'll be fine. ...You'll be fine. ...You'll be fine. ...You'll be fine. ...You'll be fine. Heaven knows you're lost but you'll be fine, you'll be fine. Heaven knows we're lost but the sun still shines, we'll be fine."
