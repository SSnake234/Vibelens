  "lyrics": "   Why you gotta hug me like that Every time you see me? Why you always making me laugh Swear you're catching feelings I loved you from the start So it breaks my heart When you say I'm just a friend to you Cause friends don't do the things we do Everybody knows you love me too Tryna be careful with the words I use I say it cause I'm dying to I'm so much more than just a friend to you When there's other people around You never wanna kiss me You tell me it's too late to hang out And you say you miss me I loved you from the start So it breaks my heart When you say I'm just a friend to you Cause friends don't do the things we do Everybody knows you love me too Tryna be careful with the words I use I say it cause I'm dying to I'm so much more than just a friend to you You-oh-oh-oh- oh You-oh-oh-oh- oh You-oh-oh-oh- oh You-oh-oh-oh- oh When you say I'm just a friend to you Cause friends don't do the things we do Everybody knows you love me too Tryna be careful with the words I use I say it cause I'm dying to I'm so much more than just a friend to you A friend to you A friend to you A friend to you"
