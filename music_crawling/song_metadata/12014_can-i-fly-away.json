So god bless my soul the pain I feel won't nobody know cuz this world is evil and everytime i wake up i wanna go home so what am i to do but sing a song for you cuz i feel you also that's why i'll never let you go they say i lost my mind but i did that so long ago so when i close my eyes leave me alone so if i go to sleep cuz only in my dreams can i fly away! can i fly away! can i fly away! can i fly away! fly away ! but at night these angels be singing to me so as i lay awake at night i drift away into the sky and that's where i reside oh yeah, oh yeah so pray that i'll be just fine i see you when it's time i'll see you when it's time so if i go to sleep Bb---------------------C can i fly away! can i fly away! can i fly away! can i fly away! fly away ! so much tragedy have i found"
