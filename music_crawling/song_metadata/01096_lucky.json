  "lyrics": "Now do ya hear me talking to you Across the water, across the deep blue ocean Under the open sky, oh my Baby I'm trying Boy I hear you in my dreams I feel your whisper across the sea I keep you with me in my heart You make it easier when life gets hard Lucky I'm in love with my best friend Lucky to have been where I have been Lucky to be coming home again Ooooh ooh oooooh ooh-ooooooh.... They don't know how long it takes Waiting for a love like this Every time we say goodbye, I wish we had one more kiss I'll wait for you, I promise you, I will Lucky I'm in love with my best friend Lucky to have been where I have been Lucky to be coming home again Lucky we're in love in every way Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed Lucky to be coming home some day And so I'm sailing, through the sea To an island, where we'll meet You'll hear the music, fill the air I put a flower in you hair And though the breezes through the trees Move so pretty, you're all I see Let the world keep spinning round You hold me right here, right now I'm lucky I'm in love with my best friend Lucky to have been where I have been Lucky to be coming home again Lucky we're in love in every way Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed Lucky to be coming home some day oooooh oooh-ooooo ooh ooooh-oo ooh."
