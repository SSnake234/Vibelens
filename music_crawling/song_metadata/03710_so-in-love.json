  "lyrics": "Intro: / / Spring, summer, fall &amp; winter dreams.. Those are shinning like a star. They keep whispering, \" I'm so in love with you \" Spring, summer, fall &amp; winter love.. It is breezing to my heart and it keeps telling \" I'll make you rainbow smile \" I re member when we were angels. When we dreamed about us. All my days were happy just like a snowy christmas I wish I'd have them always.. Every step I make writes a story. It is full of the heart feeling love of my life and missing friends of my time. I wish I'd have them all... VIOLIN SOLO: / / / / / / /"
