Let me give you a thought I'm gonna be right by your side no matter what In the dark of the night. In the dark of the night In the light of the day. In the light of the day When you're rising to shine. When you're rising to shine When you're hitting the hay. When you're hitting the hay I'll be hanging around. I'll be hanging around If you like it or not. If you like it or not I'm gonna be right by your side no matter what! No matter what No matter what. No matter what No matter what No matter what No matter what. No matter what No matter what Oh, I'm gonna be Oh, I'm gonna be. Right by your side Right by your side I'm gonna be right by your side no matter what In the dark of the night. In the light of the day When you're rising to shine. When you're hitting the hay Just remember this song. How's it go? I for got I'm gonna be right by your side no matter what Through whoever you've been. Through whoever you've been Through whoever you'll be. Through whoever you'll be Through whatever you lose. Through whatever you lose You will always have me. You will always have me At the end of your rope. At the end of your rope I'll be holding you taut. I'll be holding you taut I'm gonna be right by your side no matter what Be right by your side Be right by your side Be right by your side no matter what"
