When I see the leaves start fallin' I wanna see you The only thing I'll do Is to rush and run to you When I hear the clock start tiching I start to miss you Ooh... The only thing I'll do Is gonna dream of you Wanna stay by by by your side You are my everything You are my only link To the angel's wings Talk about love love and I can't stop thinking of you Such a crazy thing Like snow fallin' in spring    When I hear the bird start singing I wanna see you Ooh... The only thing I'll do Is to rush and run to you When I hear the clock start tiching I start to miss you Ooh... The only thing I'll do Is start to dream of you I found my angel in my life I cannot see why I cannot see why We can't be in love till we die Wanna stay by by by your side You are my everything You are my only link To the angel's wings Talk about love love and I can't stop thinking of you Such a crazy thing Like snow fallin' in spring One day we'll spread our wings You and me da, you and me da... Spread our wings do... Do... Do... Wanna be wanna be wanna I wanna be Be your lover I'll run to you.. . Ooh..."
