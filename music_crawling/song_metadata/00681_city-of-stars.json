City of stars, there's so much that I can't see Who knows, I felt it from the first embrace I shared with you That now our dreams may finally come true City of stars, just one thing everybody wants There in the bars and through the smokescreen of the crowded restaurant It's love, yes all we're looking for is love from someone else A rush, a glance, a touch, a dance Look in somebody's eyes to light up the skies To open the world and send me reeling A voice that says I'll be here and you'll be alright I don't care if I know just where I will go Cos all that I need’s this crazy feeling A ra-ta-tat of my heart Think I want it to stay City of stars, are you shining just for me? City of stars, you never shined so brightly"
