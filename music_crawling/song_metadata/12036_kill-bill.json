I might kill my ex I still love him though Rather be in jail than alone I get the sense that it's a lost cause I get the sense that you might really love her The text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence I tried to ration with you, no murders or crime of passion But damn, you was out of reach You was at the farmers market with your perfect peach Now I'm in amazement, planning home invasion Got me saying over a beat I'm so mature, I'm so mature, I'm so mature I don't want none, I just want you If I can't have you, no one will, oh I might kill my ex Not the best idea His new girlfriend's next How'd I get here? I might kill my ex I still love him though Rather be in jail than alone I did it all for love I did it all on no drugs I did all of this sober I did it all for us, oh I did it all for love I did all of this on no drugs I did all of this sober Oh I just killed my ex Not the best idea (idea) Killed his girlfriend next How'd I get here? I just killed my ex I still love him though (I do)"
