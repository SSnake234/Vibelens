When I dial the tele phone..... Nobody's home - - - - - All by my self Don't wanna be All by my self Any more Hard to be sure Sometimes I feel so inse cure..... And loves so distant and obs cure..... Remains the cure - - - - - All by my self Don't wanna be All by my self Any more All by my self Don't wanna be All by my self Any more When I was young I never needed any one..... And making love was just for fun..... Those days are gone All by my self Don't wanna be All by my self Any more!!!..... ...By my self - - - - All by my self Don't wanna live - Don't wanna live By my self, by myself An ymore"
