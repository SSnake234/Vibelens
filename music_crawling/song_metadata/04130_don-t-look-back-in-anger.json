  "lyrics": "  Slip inside the eye of your mind Don't you know you might find A better place to play You said that you'd never been But all the things that you've seen Slowly fade a way So I start a revolution from my bed Cos you said the brains I had went to my head Step outside, the summertime's in bloom Stand up beside the fireplace Take that look from off your face Cos you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out So Sally can wait, she knows it's too late as she's walking on by Her soul slides away, but don't look back in anger I heard you say    Take me to the place where you go Where nobody knows, if it's night or day Please don't put your life in the hands of a rock and roll band, who'll throw it all away Gonna start a revolution from my bed Cos you said the brains I had went to my head Step outside, the summertime's in bloom Stand up beside the fireplace Take that look from off your face Cos you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out So Sally can wait, she knows it's too late as she's walking on by Her soul slides away, but don't look back in anger I heard you say    So Sally can wait, she knows it's too late as she's walking on by Her soul slides away, but don't look back in anger I heard you say    So Sally can wait, she knows it's too late as she's walking on by Her soul slides away, but don't look back in anger Don't look back in anger I heard you say   least not to day"
