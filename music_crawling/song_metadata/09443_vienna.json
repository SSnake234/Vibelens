You better cool it off before you burn it out You got so much to do and only So many hours in a day Ay But you know that when the truth is told That you can get what you want or you can just get old You’re gonna kick off before you even get halfway through Oo oh When will you realize… Vienna waits for you? Slow down you’re doing fine You can’t be everything you want to be be- fore your time Although it’s so romantic on the Borderline to- night, to- night Too bad, but it’s the life you lead You’re so a- head of yourself that you for- got what you need Though you can see when you’re wrong You know you can’t always see when you’re right, you’re right You got your passion, you got your pride But don’t you know that only fools are satisfied? Dream on, but don’t i- magine they’ll all come true Oooh When will you realize… Vienna waits for you?    Slow down you crazy child Take the phone off the hook and disappear for a while It’s alright, you can afford to lose a day or two oooh When will you realize… Vienna waits for you? And you know that when the truth is told That you can get what you want or you can just get old You’re gonna kick off before you even get halfway through Oo oh Why don't you realize… Vienna waits for you? When will you realize… Vienna waits for you?   "
