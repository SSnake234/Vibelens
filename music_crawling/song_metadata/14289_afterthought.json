Yeah , there's no way, yeah (no way, no way, no way) To burn, there's no flames, yeah (there's no flames) Praying nine to five like a saint for you (like a saint) Can you tell me how it turned this way? (How?) Yeah , things have changed, yeah (yeah) Yeah, filled with rage, yeah (filled with rage) So lost in these diamonds Don't speed on that highway When life gets too complicated I'll stay in the limelight Like a beautiful after thought Sometimes, you'd ask me for something different Hated when you did it, I wish that you didn't I would do things and you'd get annoyed I should've never done them, I wish I was different Why do we have to step away now? Since you called me sayin' you're worried Been hard for me dealin' with this space now 'Cause I'm sorry, but you don't want me So lost in these diamonds Don't speed on that highway When life gets too complicated I'll stay in the limelight Like a beautiful after thought I don't ...wanna forget about you I don't ...wanna forget about you, oh I don't ...wanna forget about you I don't ...wanna think about it"
