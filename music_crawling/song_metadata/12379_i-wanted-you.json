  "lyrics": "...Lately I've been thinking 'bout wat i can do ...I've been stressing to fall back in love with you ...I'm so sorry that I couldn't follow through But I can't go on this way ...You've been wonder ful in all that you can be ...But it hurts when you say that you understand me ...So believe me I, I am sorry I.. I am sorry I, I I wanted you to be there when I fall I wanted you to see me through it all I wanted you to be the one I love I wanted you, I wanted you I wanted you to hold me in my sleep I wanted you to show me what I need I wanted you to know just how down deep I wanted you, I wanted you ...I've been pushing hard to open up the door ...Trying to take us back to where we were before ...But I'm done I just can't do this anymore Cause we can't be mended ...We've been walking round in circles for some time ...And I think we should head for the finish line ...So believe me I, I am sorry I.. I am sorry I, I I wanted you to be there when I fall I wanted you to see me through it all I wanted you to be the one I love I wanted you, I wanted you I wanted you to hold me in my sleep I wanted you to show me what I need I wanted you to know just how down deep I wanted you, I wanted you I, I I'm so sorry baby but I, I I've got to pack up and leave but I, I'll always remember how we came close to being what I wanted to be I wanted you baby Oooo oh Am I wanted you to be there when I fall I wanted you to see me through it all I wanted you to be the one I love I wanted you, I wanted you I wanted you to hold me in my sleep I wanted you to show me what I need I wanted you to know just how down deep I wanted you, I wanted you"
