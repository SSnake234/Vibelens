  "lyrics": "Don't bury me Don't let me down Don't say it's over Cause that would send me under Underneath the ground Don't say those words I wanna live and your words can murder Only you can send me under, under, under 1. I die every time you walk away Don't leave me alone with me See, I'm afraid Of the darkness Of the voices Saying nothing's gonna be ok Ay... I feel it in my heart Soul, mind that I’m losing you, me You're abusing every reason I have left to live 2. Lost trust to anyone crams a soul All the sanity I ever owned gone But I’m still breathing Through the thunder And the fire and the madness Just to let you shoot me down again But I’m still breathing I feel it in my veins, skin, bones That I’m losing you, me You're confu sing Every reason I have left to live   3. Chasing you but you don't look back Words are through hat I can't take back Reaching out but I can't hold on to you no Chasing you but you don't look back Words are through that I can't take back Reaching out but I can't hold on to you  "
