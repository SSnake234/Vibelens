Everything inside you is dark and twisted Oh but it's okay to be different 'Cause baby, so am I (so am I, so am I, so am I-I-I-I-I) Can you hear the whispers all across the room? You feel her eyes all over you like cheap perfume You're beautiful, but misunderstood So why you tryna be just like the neighborhood? I can see it, I know what you're feeling So let me tell you 'bout my little secret I'm a little crazy underneath this Underneath this Do you ever feel like a misfit? Everything inside you is dark and twisted Oh but it's okay to be different Cause baby, so am I (so am I, so am I, so am I-I-I-I-I) Do you ever feel like an outcast? You don't have to fit into the format Oh but it's okay to be different 'Cause baby, so am I (so am I, so am I, so am I-I-I-I-I) Oh so, dressed so fancy like Sid and Nancy (Yeah) Walkin Killer Queen, gotta keep 'em guessin' So baby come pass me a lighter We're gonna leave 'em on fire, we're the sinners and the blessings I can see it, I know what you're feeling So let me tell you 'bout my little secret I'm a little crazy underneath this Underneath this, ohhh ohh-oh Do you ever feel like a misfit? Everything inside you is dark and twisted Oh but it's okay to be different 'Cause baby, so am I (so am I, so am I, so am I-I-I-I-I) Do you ever feel like an outcast? You don't have to fit into the format Oh but it's okay to be different 'Cause baby, so am I (so am I, so am I, so am I-I-I-I-I) (Ah-ah-ah) You're king and you're queen You're strong and you're weak, you're bound but so free (Ah-ah-ah) Sov come and join me And call me Harley and we'll make a scene Do you ever feel like a misfit? Everything inside you is dark and twisted Oh but it's okay to be different 'Cause baby, so am I (so am I, so am I, so am I-I-I-I-I) Do you ever feel like an outcast? You don't have to fit into the format Oh but it's okay to be different 'Cause baby, so am I (so am I, so am I, so am I-I-I-I-I)"
