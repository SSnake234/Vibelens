  "lyrics": "Come and take a trip in my rocket ship We'll have a lovely after noon Kiss the world goodbye and a way we fly Desti nation moon. We'll go up, up, up, up, straight to the moon, we two; High in the starry blue I'll be out of this world with you So a way we steal in a space mobile A supersonic honey moon Leave your cares below, pull the switch, let's go! Desti nation moon."
