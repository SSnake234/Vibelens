You should take a moment to relax and enjoy it We could share a crêpe sucrée At this Parisian café Phineas: Huh. That awning could be used as a sail! Or, you know, a parachute, depending on how things go Isabella: Take a break and smell these flowers Underneath the Eiffel Tower Phineas: I wonder if they still have pieces of that hanging around? The rivets would come in handy Won't you share a crème brûlée with me ? Isabella: How perfect could this be In the City of Love ? Couples: (In the City of Love) Isabella: In the City of Love Ferb: (In the City of Love) Isabella: We could try some fancy cheese Or peruse the galleries Phineas: I wonder if oil-based paint is combustible...as a rocket fuel Isabella: Isn't this a perfect day? How do I look in this beret? Isabella: Oh, how can he not feel the same way When we're strolling down the Champs-Élysées In the City of Love? Lady: (In the City of Love) Isabella: I wish that he would whisper \"ma chérie, je t'aime\" But all he wants to do is try to fix that plane In the City of Love Artist: (In the City of Love) Isabella: In the City of Love (in the City of Love)"
