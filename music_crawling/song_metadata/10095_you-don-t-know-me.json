I'll show you all the stars I used to hide No one seemed to realize Baby, you don't know me But baby, you don't know. But baby, you don't know. But baby, you don't know. But baby, you don't know. But baby, you don't know. Take me to the place I used to run Remember the house that I was born Baby, you don't know me But baby, you don't know. I'll show you all the stars I used to hide No one seemed to realize Baby, you will know me Baby, you will know. But baby, you don't know. But baby, you don't know. But baby, you don't know. But baby, you don't know. But baby, you don't know."
