  "lyrics": "I'd like to play a game, that is so much fun, And it's not so very hard to do, The name of the game is Simple Simon says, And I would like for you to play it to, Put your hands in the air, (Simple Simon says) Shake them all a bout, (Simple Simon says) Do it when Simon says, (Simple Simon says) And you will never be out. Simple Simon says, put your hands on your head, Let your back bone stretch, Simon says, Simple simon says, put your hands on your head, Let your back bone stiff, Simon says, Put your hands on your head, (Simple Simon says) Bring them down by your side, (Simple Simon says) Shake them to your left, (Simple Simon Says) Now shake them to your right, Put your hands on your head, (Simple Simon says) Bring them down by your side, (Simple Simon says) Shake them to your left, (Simple Simon Says) Now shake them to your right, Now that you have learnt to play this game with me, You can see its not so hard to do, Lets try it once again this time more carefully, And I hope the winner will be you. Clap your hands in the air, (Simple Simon says) Do it double time, (Simple Simon says) Slow it down like be fore, (Simple Simon says) Ah, your looking fine. Clap your hands in the air, (Simple Simon says) Do it double time, (Simple Simon says) Slow it down like be fore, (Simple Simon says) Ah, your looking fine."
