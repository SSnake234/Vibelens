  "lyrics": "  ...You are the one, girl You know that it's true  ...I'm feeling younger Every time that I'm alone with you  ...We were sitting in a parked car ...Stealing kisses in a front yard ...We got questions we shouldn't had asked but How would you feel  If I told you I loved you  It's just something that I want to do  I'm taking my time, spending my life Falling deeper in love with you  So tell me that you love me too  ...In the summer , as the lilacs bloom  ...Blood flows deeper than a river Every moment that I spend with you  ...We were sat upon our best friend's roof I had both of my arms around you Watching the sunrise replace the moon How would you feel  If I told you I loved you  It's just something that I want to do  I'm taking my time, spending my life Falling deeper in love with you  So tell me that you love me too      ...We were sitting in a parked car ....Stealing kisses in a front yard ....We got questions we shouldn't had asked but How would you feel  If I told you I loved you  It's just something that I want to do  I'm taking my time, spending my life Falling deeper in love with you  So tell me that you love me too  Tell me that you love me too Tell me that you love me too "
