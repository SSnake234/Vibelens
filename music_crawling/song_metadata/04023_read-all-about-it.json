  "lyrics": " You've got the words to change a nation but you're biting your tongue You've spent a life time stuck in silence afraid you'll say something wrong If no one ever hears it how we gonna learn your song? So come on come on, come on, come on You've got a heart as loud as lions, so why let your voice be tamed? Baby we're a little different there's no need to be ashamed You've got the light to fight the shadows so stop hiding it away Come on, Come on I wanna sing, I wanna shout I wanna scream till the words dry out o put it in all of the papers, I'm not afraid they can read all about it, read all about it oh oh-oh- oh oh- oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh- oh oh- oh-oh oh-oh- oh At night we're waking up the neighbours while we sing away the blues Making sure that we remember yeah cause we all matter too If the truth has been forbidden then we're breaking all the rules So come on come on, come on, come on Let’s get the tv and the radio to play our tune again Its 'bout time we got some airplay of our version of events There's no need to be afraid, I will sing with you my friend Come on, Come on I wanna sing, I wanna shout I wanna scream till the words dry out o put it in all of the papers, I'm not afraid they can read all about it, read all about it oh oh-oh- oh oh- oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh- oh oh- oh-oh oh-oh- oh Yeah we're all wonderful, wonderful people so when did we all get so fearful? Now we're finally finding our voices so take a chance, come help me sing this Yeah we're all wonderful, wonderful people so when did we all get so fearful? Now we're finally finding our voices so take a chance, come help me sing this I wanna sing, I wanna shout I wanna scream till the words dry out o put it in all of the papers, I'm not afraid they can read all about it, read all about it oh oh-oh- oh oh- oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh- oh oh- oh-oh oh-oh- oh Ohhhh"
