  "lyrics": "I swear by the moon and the stars in the  sky. And I swear, like the shadow that's by your side. I see the questions in your eyes, I know what's weighing on your mind, but you can be sure I know my part. 'Cause I'll stand beside you through the years, You'll only cry those happy tears. And though I'll make mistakes, I'll never break your heart. And I swear, by the moon and the stars in the sky, I'll be there. I swear, like the shadow that's by your side, I'll be there. For better or worse, till death do us part, I'll love you with every beat of my heart, I   swear I'll give you ev'rything I can, I'll build your dreams with these two hands, and we'll hang some mem'ries on the walls. And when just the two of us are there, you won't have to ask if I still care, 'cause as time turns the page my love won't age at all. And I swear, by the moon and the stars in the sky, I'll be there. I swear, like the shadow that's by your side, I'll be there. For better or worse, till death do us part, I'll love you with every beat of my heart, I swear"
