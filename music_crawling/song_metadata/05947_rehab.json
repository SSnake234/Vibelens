  "lyrics": " When we first met I never felt something so strong You were like my lover and my best friend All wrapped in one with a ribbon on it And all of a sudden you went and left I didn't know how to follow. It's like a shock that spun me around And now my heart's dead I feel so empty and hollow. And I'll never give myself to another the way I gave it to you You don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you? It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back And you're the one to blame. And now I feel like....oh! . Bridge: DO THE SAME: . , , , ."
