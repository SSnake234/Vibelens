  "lyrics": "  Another day goes by and i still count the day you’re gone Another lonely night and im still dreaming about you Wondering if i could see you one summer night Full of stars above the sky we kiss and we”ll be aright Please say You miss me Please say u still need me I”ll be, the one, right here waiting for you For now, always till the day u come back Promise, we start, again You may feel the cold when i get burned by the sun You may feel alone when i suppose to be by your side If you miss me baby please look up the sky For the sunshine wrap your skin and the wind flip your hair. I”ll be   you got the whole world to see and i just need one to be but anywhere and day the sun’s always behind the cloud by the sunset that’s the only change they could embrace so at the end of your road my heart will be your home."
