  "lyrics": "Anywhere you are, I am near, Anywhere you go, I'll be there, Anytime you whisper my name, you’ll see, Oh, every single promise I’ll keep, 'Cause what kind of guy would I be, If I was to leave when you need me most, What are words if you really don’t mean them when you say them, What are words if they’re only for good times then they’re don't, When its love, yeah you say them out loud, those words, they never go away , They live on, even when were gone. And I know an angel will say, Just for me and I know I meant, To be where I am and I’m gonna be, Standin’ right beside her tonight , And I’m gonna be by your side, I would never leave when she needs me most . What are words if you really don’t mean them when you say them, What are words if they’re only for good times then they’re don't, When its love, yeah you say them out loud, those words, they never go away , They live on, even when were gone. Anywhere you are, I am near, Anywhere you go, I'll be there, And I'm gonna be here forever more , Every single promise I'll keep, 'Cause what kind of guy would I be, If I was to leave when you need me most,"
