Suit case of memor ies... Time after... Some times you picture me, I'm walk - ing too far ahe ad. You're calling to me, I can't hear what you've said. Then you say, Go s low, - I fall be hind. The second hand un winds. If you're lost, you can look and you will find me time after time. If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting Time after time. If you're lost, you can look and you will find me time after time. If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting Time after time.   (X2) Af - ter my picture fades and dark - ness has turned to grey, Watch - ing through win - dows, you're wonderi ng if I'm ok - ay. Sec rets stol - en from deep ins ide, The drum beats out of time. If you're lost, you can look and you will find me time after time. If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting Time after time.    You say, Go slow, I fall be hind. The se cond ha nd unwi nds. If you're lost, you can look and you will find me time after time. If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting Time after time. Time after time."
