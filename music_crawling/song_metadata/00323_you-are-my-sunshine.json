  "lyrics": "You are my sunshine, my only sunshine You make me happy when skies are gray You'll never know dear, how much I love you Please don't take my sunshine away The other night dear, as I lay sleeping I dreamed I held you in my arms When I awoke dear, I was mistaken So I hung my head and cried I'll always love you and make you happy If you will only say the same But if you leave me to love another You'll regret it all some day You told me once dear, you really loved me And no one else could come bet- ween But now you've left me and love another You have shattered all my dreams love"
