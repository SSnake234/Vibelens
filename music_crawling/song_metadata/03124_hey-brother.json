Oh, if the sky comes falling down for you, There’s nothing in this world I wouldn’t do. Hey brother, do you still believe in one another? Hey sister, do you still believe in love, I wonder? Oh, if the sky comes falling down for you, There’s nothing in this world I wouldn’t do. Oh oh oh, What if I'm far from home? Oh, brother I will hear you call. What if I lose it all? Oh, sister I will help you out! Oh, if the sky comes falling down for you, There’s nothing in this world I wouldn’t do. Hey brother, there’s an endless road to re-discover. Hey sister, do you still believe in love, I wonder? Oh, if the sky comes falling down for you, There’s nothing in this world I wouldn’t do. Oh oh oh, What if I'm far from home? Oh, brother I will hear you call. What if I lose it all? Oh, sister I will help you out! Oh, if the sky comes falling down for you, There’s nothing in this world I wouldn’t do."
