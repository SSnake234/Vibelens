  "lyrics": "If the hero, never comes to you If you need someone, you’re feeling blue If you wait for love, and you’re alone If you call your friends, no body’s home You can run away, but you can’t hide Through a storm and through a lonely night Then I’ll show you there’s a destiny The best things in life, they are free But if you wanna cry: cry on my shoulder If you need some one, who cares for you If you’re feeling sad, your heart gets colder Yes I show you what real love can do If your sky is grey oh let me know There’s a place in heaven, where we’ll go If heaven is, a million years a way Oh just call me and I’ll make your day When the nights are getting cold and blue When the days are getting hard for you I will always stay by your side I promise you, I’ll never hide"
