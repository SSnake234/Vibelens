A long the way In this great future, You can't forget your past ...So dry your tears, I say No woman no cry No woman no cry ...Oh little darling, don't shed no tears No woman no cry 'Cause I re member when we used to sit In the govern ment yard in trenchtown ...When Georgie would make the fire lights I say, log would burnin' through the nights Everything 's gonna be alright Everything 's gonna be alright Everything 's gonna be alright now Everything 's gonna be alright Everything 's gonna be alright Everything 's gonna be alright now"
