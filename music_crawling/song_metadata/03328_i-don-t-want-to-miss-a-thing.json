  "lyrics": "I could stay awake just to hear you breathin' Watch you smile while you are sleepin', while you're far away dreamin' I could spend my life in this sweet surrender I could stay lost in this moment, forever Every moment spent, with you is a moment I treasure ...I don't want to close my eyes ...I don't want to fall asleep 'cause I'd miss you baby and I don't want to miss a thing 'cause even when I dream of you ...the sweetest dream will never do I'd still miss you baby and I don't want to miss a thing Lyin close to you feeling your heart beating and I'm wonderin' what you're dreaming, wonderin' if it's me you're seein' Then I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together I just want to stay with you in this moment forever, forever and ever I don't want to miss one smile, I don't want to miss one kiss I just want to be with you right here with you, just like this I just want to hold you close, feel your heart so close to mine and just stay here in this moment, for all the rest of time"
