  "lyrics": "  I only wanted to have fun learning to fly, learning to run I let my heart decide the way when I as young Deep down I must have always known That this would be inevitable to earn my stripes I'd have to pay and bear my soul H mm m.... H mm m.... H mm m.... I know I'm not the only one who regrets the things they've done sometimes I just feel it's only me who can't stand the reflection that they see I wish I could live a little more look up to the sky, not just the floor I feel like my light is flashing by And all I can do is watch and cry I miss the air, I miss my friends I miss my mother; I miss it when Life was a party to be thrown But that was a mi- llion years a - go   When I walk around all of the streets where I grew up and found my feet they can't look me in the eye it's like they're scared of me I try to think of things to say Like a joke or a memory But they don't recognize me now In light of day H mm m.... H mm m.... H mm m.... I know I'm not the only one who regrets the things they've done sometimes I just feel it's only me who never became who they thought they'd be I wish I could live a little more look up to the sky, not just the floor I feel like my light is flashing by And all I can do is watch and cry I miss the air, I miss my friends I miss my mother; I miss it when Life was a party to be thrown But that was a mi- llion years a - go A mi- llion years a - go"
