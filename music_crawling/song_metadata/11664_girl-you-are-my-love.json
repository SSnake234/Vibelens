  "lyrics": "Girl you are my love You're my heart and soul You're my shining star My love is just for you I'll be feeling blue Living without you. Every breath that I take And every step I want to make I want to share my love with you Right till the end of time. I want to hold you by my side I want to make you stay to- night Girl somehow I know deep inside Your heart that you need my tender touch."
