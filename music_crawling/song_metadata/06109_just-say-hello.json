  "lyrics": "It's over now we lost our way in the dark I don't know, Where to go when you're gone Too late to tell you You're where I belong Still trembling now I'm scared to move on The tears I cried No matter how hard I try Can't change that All we had Is long gone Your heart can see that This love is enough And I'd give everything for one more try. You know I wanna be Your destiny So please just say hello This love is haunting me And I just need to know And all the memories Are keeping me awake at night I'm still not over you There's nothing I could do."
