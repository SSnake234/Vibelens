Ain’t nobody bringing us down down down down down down They could try but we’re gonna wear the crown You could go another round round round round round round round Wish you luck but you’re not bringing us down We go hard Till we get it get it We go hard We so in it in it We POP/ STARS Only winning winning now Ain’t nobody bringing us down down down down Hey! So keep your eyes on me now 무엇을 보든 좋아할 거야 We’re so tough Can you feel the rush now? Ain’t nobody bringing us down down down down down down They could try but we’re gonna wear the crown You could go another round round round round round round round Wish you luck but you’re not bringing us down We go hard Till we get it get it We go hard We so in it in it We POP/ STARS Only winning winning now Ain’t nobody bringing us down down down down     Oh... 난 멈 추지 않아 Oh oh we go hard Oh oh we POP/ STARS (stars), stars (stars) Ain’t nobody bringing us down down down down down down They could try but we’re gonna wear the crown You could go another round round round round round round round Wish you luck but you’re not bringing us down We go hard Till we get it get it We go hard We so in it in it We POP/ STARS Only winning winning now Ain’t nobody bringing us"
