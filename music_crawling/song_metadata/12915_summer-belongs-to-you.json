  "lyrics": "It been a long, long day And there were moments when I doubted That we'd ever reach the point Where we could laugh and sing about it Now the sun has set on this, Another extraordinary day And when it comes around a gain You know I'll say Tell me what you wanna do today All we need is a place to start If we have heart, we'll make it 'Cause we're not messin' around (we're not messin' around) Yes we can dream it, do it, build it, make it I know we can really take it To the limit before the sun goes down As soon as you wake up you gotta make your move Don't miss the beat, just get into the groove lot that you can do (a lot that you can do  ) There's a world of possibilities outside your door Why settle for a little, you can get much more Don't need an invitation, every day is new Yes, it's true Summer belongs to you (summer belongs to you) Summer belongs to you (summer belongs to you) Summer belongs to everyone, so have some fun There's nothing better to do Summer belongs to you I traveled halfway 'round the world And almost turned and ran away But you helped me get my courage back So now I've got to say That though I've often thought of you As just a nuisance and a bother Today I can't imagine Having better little brothers And you gotta believe in something So t oday I bel ieved in you And you came t hrough, we made it I've never been so proud (never been so proud) I know at first it seemed implausible But we accomplished the impossible Now there's something that I've got to say out loud Time is what you make of it, so take a chance Life is full of music so you ought to dance for your d ebut(it's time for your de but) Don't waste a minute sitting on that chair The world is callin' to you, just get out there You can see forever so your dreams are all in view Yes it's true Summer belongs to you (summer belongs to you) Summer belongs to you (summer belongs to you) Summer belongs to everyone, so have some fun There's nothing better to do Summer belongs to you (summer belongs to you) Summer belongs to you (summer belongs to you) Summer belongs to boys and girls all around the world We would n't say it if it wasn't true Summer belongs to you (summer belongs to you) Baby, baby, baby, baby Summer belongs to you (summer belongs to you) Summer belongs to you (summer belongs to you) Whatever you w ant to do, you make the rules You got the tools to see it through Summer belongs to you (summer belongs to you) Summer belongs to you (summer belongs to you) Just remember that you can do it and when you're through it Will c hange your point of view Summer belongs to you!"
