Last night it hit me When I had this crazy dream Of waking up In your house On a san francisco street We tune out all the nasty weather And it's all in front of you and me You were intriguing Just looking at a magazine Like when I first saw you Back in two thousand and three Then you walked over and Said: \"you don't have to be alone.\" I don't have a crystal ball... There's no way that I could've known (I'd be) waking up In your house On a san francisco street We tune out all the nasty weather And it's all in front of you and me Waking up In your house On a san francisco street We tune out all the nasty weather And it's all in front of you All in front of you and me oh, oh Interlude:     Yeah... Waking up In your house On a san francisco street We tune out all the nasty weather And it's all in front of you and me Waking up In your house On a san francisco street We tune out all the nasty weather Then it's all in front of you All in front of you and me San francisco street You and me  So only front of you, yeah You and me San francisco street, you and me Oh, oh"
