  "lyrics": "When there is love , I can’t wait to talk about it. When things get rough, I like to walk with you. Or when it’s night , I like to be the light that’s missing, And remind you every minute of the future isn’t written. Not yet.    When there is love , Or when the heart feels heavy, we can lighten it up. If you’ve had enough , Well, you can empty your glass and we can fill it back up. You know, it’s up to us to make it all up. So what you making up? I can make it up that you could be loved no matter what. You know, the only time is right now; It’s right where, where you are. You don’t need a vacation When there’s nothing to escape from. Ha, la-la, la-la-la, la, yeah . Ha, la-la, la-la -la, Let’s all sing. La-la-la, la-la -la, Lay me down. Everything is sound. Let’s sing to be happy, to feel things, to communicate and be heard. We sing out to protest and to project and to harmonize with birds. Whether it’s your birthday or your dying day, it’s a celebration to rejoice, To use your voice and give wings to any old choice. Whatever you’re choosing, right now Is right where, where you are. You don’t need a vacation When there’s nothing to escape from. Set your vibration and undulation To the highest it can go. And trust me, hear me. If it makes you wanna sing, Ha, la-la, la-la-la, la, yeah . Ha, la-la, la-la -la, Let’s all sing. La-la-la, la-la -la, Lay me down. Everything is sound. Ha-le-la, le-la- la, la, yeah. Ha-le-la, le- la-la, Let’s all sing. Ha-le-l a-le-la- lalelujah. Well, it’s a song that I’d forgotten often . It doesn’t make me wrong, ’Cause we all need the darkness to see the light In our own eyes. Come on and sing it… Ha, la-la, la-la-la, la, yeah . Ha, la-la, la-la -la, Let’s all sing. La-la-la, la-la -la, Lay me down. Everything is sound. Ha-le-la, le-la-la, la, yeah. Ha-le-la, le- la-la, Let’s all sing. Ha-le-la-le- la- lalelujah. We’re connected now. -last time end on -"
