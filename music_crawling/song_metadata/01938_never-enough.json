Will you share this with me? ‘Cause darling without you All the shine of a thousand spotlights All the stars we steal from the nightsky Will never be enough Never be enough Towers of gold are still too little These hands could hold the world but it’ll Never be enough Never be enough For me Never, never Never, never Never, for me Never enough Never enough Never enough For me All the shine of a thousand spotlights All the stars we steal from the nightsky Will never be enough Never be enough Towers of gold are still too little These hands could hold the world but it’ll Never be enough Never be enough For me Never, never Never, never Never, for me Never enough Never enough Never enough For me"
