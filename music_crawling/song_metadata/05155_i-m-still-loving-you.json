  "lyrics": "When I close my eyes i think of you And the time we had been through Even though were for apart right now I remember back when you were here with me How you made my world complete But now I'm left alone We talked about love and hope Wishing we could start a life our own I wish that I could live without you Why did you tear my heart apart You said you love me from the start All those painful things you put me through But I'm still loving you I tried to give my best to you I don't deserve the things you do Everything has gone to memories I just wish I konw the truth behind the lies"
