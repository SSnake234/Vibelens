  "lyrics": "    Friday night and the lights are low, looking out for a place to go where they play the right music, getting in the swing, you come to look for a king. Anybody could be that guy, night is young and music's high. With a bit of rock music everything is fine. You're in the mood for a dance.  And when you get the chance... You are the dancing queen, young and sweet, only seventeen. Dancing queen, feel the beat from the tambourine.  You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life. See that girl, watch that scene, dig in the dancing queen. You're a teaser, you turn 'em on, Leave 'em burning and then you're gone, Looking out for another, anyone will do, You're in the mood for a dance.  And when you get the chance... You are the dancing queen, young and sweet, only seventeen. Dancing queen, feel the beat from the tambourine.  You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life. See that girl, watch that scene, dig in the dancing queen."
