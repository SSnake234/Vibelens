I go out to the bar, fuck hanging with the stars Don't even have a car, but you would wait for me  All, all, all, all the pretty girls in the world But I'm in this space with you Colored out the lines, I came to find, my fire was fate with you My heartache would stay with you, escape with you I like my girls just like I like my honey, sweet A little selfish, huh I like my women like I like my money, green A little jealous Oh, I'm a beautiful wreck A colorful mess, but I'm funny Oh, I'm a heartbreak vet With a stone-cold neck, I'm so charming! ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh uhuhhhhh La la la..."
