  "lyrics": "Intro:  When the cold wind is calling and the sky is clear and bright, Misty mountains sing and beckon, lead me out into the light. I will ride, I will fly Chase the wind, and touch the sky. I will fly, Chase the wind, and touch the sky. Na-na Na-na Na-na Na-na Na Na Na-na Na Na-na Na-na  N a-na Na-na Na-na Na Na Na-na Na  Where dark woods hide secrets, and mountains are fierce and bold. Deep waters hold reflections of times lost long a- go. I will hear their every story, take hold of my own dream, Be as strong as the seas are stormy and proud as an eagles scream. I will ride, I will fly Chase the wind, and touch the sky. I will fly, Chase the wind, and touch the sky. Na-na Na-na Na-na Na-na Na Na Na-na Na Na-na Na-na  N a-na Na-na Na-na Na Na Na-na Na   ~~~ Tab from: http://www.guitartabs.cc/tabs/j/julie_fowlis/touch_the_sky_crd_ver_2.html"
