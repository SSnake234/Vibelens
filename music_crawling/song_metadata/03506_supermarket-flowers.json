  "lyrics": "  I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill I threw the day old tea from the cup ..Packed up the photo album Matthew had made Memories of a life that’s been loved Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals Poured the old ginger beer down the sink ..Dad always told me don’t you cry when you’re down But mum there’s a tear every time that I blink ...ohi’min pieces it’s tearing me up but I know ... A heart that’s broke is a heart that’s been loved So I’ll sing Hallelujah You were an angel in the shape of my mum When I fell down you’d be there Holding me up, spread your wings as you go And when God takes you back, He’ll say Hallelujah, you’re home   I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case  John said he’d drive then put his hand on my cheek And wiped a tear from the side of my face ..And I hope that I see the world as you did cause I know ..A life with love is a life that’s been lived So I’ll sing Hallelujah You were an angel in the shape of my mum When I fell down you’d be there Holding me up, spread your wings as you go And when God takes you back, He’ll say Hallelujah, you’re home Ooh ooh ooh Ooh ooh ooh Ooh ooh ooh Ooh ooh ooh Hallelujah You were an angel in the shape of my mum You got to see the person I have become, spread your wings and I know that when God took you back, he said say Hallelujah, you’re home"
