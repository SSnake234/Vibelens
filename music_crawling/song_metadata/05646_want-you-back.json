Remember all the things that you and I did first? And now you're taking her to every restaurant And now you're taking her to every restaurant Boy you can say anything you wanna I want you back I want you back Wa-want you, want you back I broke it off thinking you'd be cryin' I want you back Wa-want you, want you back"
