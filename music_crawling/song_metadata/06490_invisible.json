  "lyrics": " Crowded Hallways are the loneliest places for outcasts and rebels Or anyone who just dares And you've been trying for so long to find out where your place is But in their narrow minds, there's no room for anyone who dares to do Oh, but listen for a minute Trust the one who's been where you are wishing all it was was sticks and stones Those words cut deep but they don't mean you're all alone You're not invisible Hear me out, there's so much more to life than what you're feeling now Someday you'll look back on all these days and all this pain is gonna be... Invisible Oh, invisible So your confidence is quiet To them quiet looks like weakness but you don't have to fight it Cause you're strong enough to win without the war Every heart has a rhythm, let yours beat out so loudly That everyone can hear it, yeah, promise you don't need to hide it anymore Oh, and never be afraid of doing something different Trust the one who's been where you are wishing all it was was sticks and stones Those words cut deep but they don't mean you're all alone You're not invisible Hear me out, there's so much more to life than what you're feeling now Someday you'll look back on all these days and all this pain is gonna be... Invisible These labels that they give you just 'cause they don't understand If you look past this moment, you'll see you've got a friend Waving a flag, for who you are, and all you're gonna do Yeah, so here's to you and here's to anyone who's ever felt  Yeah.... You're not invisible Hear me out, there's so much more to life than what you're feeling now Someday you'll look back on all these days and all this pain is gonna be... Invisible It'll be invisible"
