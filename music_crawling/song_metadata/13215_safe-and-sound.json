Just close your eyes The sun is going down You'll be alright No one can hurt you now Come morning light You and I'll be safe and sound. Don't you dare look out your window darling Everything's on fire The war outside our door keeps raging on Hold onto this lullaby Even when the music's gone. Just close your eyes The sun is going down You'll be alright No one can hurt you now Come morning light You and I'll be safe and sound. Ooooh Oooooh Ahhhhh Ahhhhhh Ooooh Oooooh Ahhhhh Ahhhhhh Just close your eyes You'll be alright Come morning light, You and I'll be safe and sound."
