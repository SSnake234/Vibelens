  "lyrics": " Looking at the pages of my | life_ Faded | _____memories of me and you_ | __Mistakes you know I've made a few_ I | took some shots and fell from time to | time_ Baby | _____you were there to pull me through_ We've | been around the block a time or | two_ I'm gonna lay it on the | line_ Ask me how we've come this | far_ The answer's written in my | eyes_ Every time I | look at you, baby, I see something | new_ That | takes me higher than before and | makes me want you more_ I don't wanna | sleep tonight, dreamin's just a | waste of time_ When I | look at what my life's been comin' | to_ I'm | all about lovin' you_ I've | lived, I've loved, I've lost, I've paid some | dues, baby_ | _____We've been to hell and back again_ Through it all you're always my best | friend_ For all the words I didn't | say and all the things I didn't | do_ To | night I'm gonna find a | way_ Every time I | look at you, baby, I see something | new_ That | takes me higher than before and | makes me want you more_ I don't wanna | sleep tonight, dreamin's just a | waste of time_ When I | look at what my life's been comin' | to_ I'm | all about lovin' you_ You can | take this world a | way_ You're every | thing I am_ __Just read the | lines upon my | face_ I'm | all about lovin' you_ Every time I | look at you, baby, I see something | new_ That | takes me higher than before and | makes me want you more_ I don't wanna | sleep tonight, dreamin's just a | waste of time_ When I | look at what my life's been comin' | to_ I'm | all about lovin' you_"
