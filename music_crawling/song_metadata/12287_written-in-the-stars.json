Might be Deja vu First time we met but I remembered you We were creepin’ in the night time Maybe in another lifetime. Don’t tell me you don’t feel what I feel right now Whoo it’s written all over you Don’t tell me you don’t feel what I feel somehow Oooh I keep findin’ my way back to you. You can go anywhere babe wherever you want Because I know we’re written in the stars You can go any which way don’t matter how far Because I know we’re written in the stars. Da dada dada da dada Dah dada dada da da No question that we’re written in the stars. Ooooh Ooooh yeah The moment … you looked at me I started losing feeling in my cheeks Felt myself moving towards ya’ I just wanted to get closer oh When you say hello I want you to be ready I’ll hold your heart if you’ll let me oh Don’t tell me you don’t feel what I feel right now Whoo it’s written all over you Don’t tell me you don’t feel what I feel somehow Oooh I keep findin’ my way back to you. You can go anywhere babe wherever you want Because I know we’re written in the stars You can go any which way don’t matter how far Because I know we’re written in the stars. Da dada dada da dada Dah dada dada da da No question that we’re written in the stars. And I promise every day(I promise every day) To make you feel this way (To make you feel this way) So that you know it’s written in the stars. Dalada dala dala Lalala dala dala Nowhere Written in the stars. Oh whoa whoa wuh Oh whoa wah wuh wuh Oh We’re written in the stars."
