  "lyrics": "  (2x) You with the sad eyes Don't be discoura ged Oh I realize Its hard to take courage In a world full of people You can lose sight of it all The darkness inside you Can make you feel so small Show me a smile then, Don't be unhappy, can't remember When I last saw you laughing If this world makes you crazy And you've taken all you can bear Just call me up 'Cause I will always be there And I'll see your true colors Shining through I see your true colors And that's why I love you So don't be afraid to let them show Your true colors True colors are beautiful, Like a rainbow"
