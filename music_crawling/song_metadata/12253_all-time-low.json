I (I, I), I've been trying to fix my pride But that shit's broken, that shit's broken Lie (lie, lie), lie, l-lie, I try to hide But now you know it That I'm at an all time Low, low, low-low-low, low, low, low, low Low, low, low-low-low, low, low, low, low Oh! I (I, I), I've been trying to fix my pride But that shit's broken, that shit's broken Lie (lie, lie), lie, l-lie, I try to hide But now you know it That I'm at an all time Low, low, low-low-low, low, low, low, low Low, low, low-low-low, low, low, low, low"
