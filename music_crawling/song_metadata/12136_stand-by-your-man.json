  "lyrics": "Intro: – – – Sometimes its hard to be a woman, Giving all your love to just one man. You'll have bad times, and he'll have good times, doing things that you don't under stand. But if you love him you'll forgive him, Even though he's hard to under stand. And if you love him, oh be proud of him, cause after all he's just a man  Stand by your man, give him two arms to cling to, and something warm to come to, when nights are cold and lonely. Stand by your man, and tell the world you love him, keep giving all the love you can. Stand by your man.  Stand by your man, and tell the world you love him, keep giving all the love you can. Stand by your man. "
