  "lyrics": "| | | | | | | | | Things were all good yesterday And then the devil took your memory And if you fell to your death today, I hope that heaven is your resting place I heard the doctors put your chest in pain then that could've been the medicine And now you're lying in the bed again Either way I'll cry with the rest of them And my father told me son It's not his fault he doesn't know your face And you're not the only one Although my grandma used to say, he used to see Darling hold me in arms the way you did last night And your life inside, a little while with you more I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up And we're wrapped in light, in life and love Put your open lips on mine, slowly let them shut for they're designed to be together With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one And we'll set alight, we're afire love  Things were all good yesterday And then the devil took your breath away And now we're left here in pain Black suit black tie standing in the rain And now my family is one again Stapled together with the strangers and a friend Came to my mind I should paint it with a pen Six years old I remember when And my father told me son It's not his fault he doesn't know your face And you're not the only one Although my grandma used to say, he used to see Darling hold me in arms the way you did last night And your life inside, a little while with you more I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up And we're wrapped in light, in life and love Put your open lips on mine, slowly let them shut for they're designed to be together With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one And we'll set alight, we're afire love  My father, and all of my family rise from their seats to sing hallelujah And my brother and all of my family rise from their seats to sing hallelujah rise from their seats to sing hallelujah | | |"
