What about me? What about me and you together? Something that could really last forever What about me? What about me? What about me and you together? Something that could really last forever If all my friends wanna be in her be and I begin to wonder why I guess that I'd be lying to myself Would be dumb enough Now two two ten one five Frankie saying oh what a night? What the fuck is a girlfriend? I made a friend and she spent the night and now I'm in love and she remains in my life And back when we spoke in Europe I can't get hurt again Fuck the past, fuck them, they all made me sad And I had no time to prepare to face my fears I guess that it's time that I dried these tears But if I could just be happy by the end of this song But if by the time you hear it you are already gone And it didn't go to plan Then why should I continue in this life When there's no one around to be the one who makes me smile? But so far everything's good Oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh I said, so far everything's good Oh oh oh Oh no no no No no no no no oh I want the crowd in tears when they hear this Is that so wrong?"
