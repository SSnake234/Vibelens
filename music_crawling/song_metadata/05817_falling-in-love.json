  "lyrics": "Intro = .......... ......... Everyday feels like a Monday, There is, no escaping from the heartache, Now I, gotta put it back together, 'Coz it's, always better late then never. Wishin' I could be in California, I wanna tell ya when I call ya, I could've fallen in love, I wish I'd fallen in love. Out of our minds and out of time Wishin' I could be with you, and to share the view, we could've fallen in love, Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Waking up to people talking and it's, getting later every morning Now I, realise it's nearly midday And I've, wasted half my life, to throw it away, Saying Everyday should be a new day, To make you smile and find a new way, of falling in love, Yeah falling in love. Out of our minds, and out of time, Wishin' I could be with you, To share the view, oh We could've fallen in love Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh We could've fallen in love Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh     (G note on low string, not chord) Sick of waiting, I can't take it gotta tell ya Sick of waiting I can't take it gotta tell ya Sick of waiting I can't take it gotta tell ya Sick of waiting I can't take it gotta tell ya Sick of waiting I can't take it gotta tell ya Sick of waiting I can't take it gotta tell ya I can't take another night on my own, so I take a breath and then I pick up the phone Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Fallen in love Oh, we could've fallen in love, oh yeah fallen in love, we could've fallen in love Oooh   "
