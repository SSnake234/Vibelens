Cause I miss you I heard a lot of birds whispering, only a bout your name Guess I know why, I started to cry Every picture in my car, reminds me the time I had.. been with you.   x2 Every little things we have been through Need a sun to shine where we want it to I'll sing this song for the rest of my life So how it's going? Cause I miss you I heard a lot of birds whispering, only a bout your name Guess I know why, I started to cry Every picture in my car, reminds me the time I had.. been with you   x2 So how it's going? Cause I miss you I heard a lot of birds whispering, only a bout your name Guess I know why, I started to cry Every picture in my car, reminds me time I had.. been with you Been with you u.. Every picture in my car, reminds me time I had.. been with you"
