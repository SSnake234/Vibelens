Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer Pain! You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer Pain! I let the bullets fly, oh let them rain My luck, my love, my God, they came from... Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer Third things third, send a prayer to the ones up above All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh Your spirit up above, oh-ooh I was choking in the crowd, living my brain up in the cloud Falling like ashes to the ground, hoping my feelings, they would drown But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing, inhibited, limited Till it broke up and it rained down, it rained down, like... Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer Pain! You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer Pain! I let the bullets fly, oh let them rain My luck, my love, my God, they came from... Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer Last things last, by the grace of the fire and the flames You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh The blood in my veins, oh- ooh But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing, inhibited, limited Till it broke up and it rained down, it rained down, like... Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer Pain! You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer Pain! I let the bullets fly, oh let them rain My luck, my love, my God, they came from... Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer"
