  "lyrics": "In the early morning hours Someone wait for you Among the blossoms and the flowers He will find you Some one saw you today But then you ran away Into the blue Who’s that shadow by the water Who has come for you In the lilac and the roses I will hide you Some how the story goes You’ve been followed by ghosts So go My little one I will sing a song until i know My little one All the night elves keep an eye on you For days and moons And days and moons i wan der The days are long but honey the moons are long er Stars a light up my way When i close my eyes and pray So go My little one I will sing a song until i know My little one All the night elves keep an eye on you For days and moons And days and moons i wan der The days are long but honey the moons are long er Stars a light up my way For days and moons And days and moons i wan der The days are long but honey the moons are long er Stars a light up my way When i close my eyes and pray In the early morning hours Someone wait for you Among the blossoms and the flowers He will find you"
