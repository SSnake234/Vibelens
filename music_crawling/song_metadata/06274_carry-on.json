  "lyrics": "    Well I woke up to the sound of silence and guns were cutting like knives in a fist fight And I found you with a bottle of wine your head in the curtains and heart like the 4th of July You swore and said we are not we are not shining stars This i know cause i never said we are Though I've never been through hell like that I've closed enough windows to know you can never look back If you're lost and alone, or you're sinkin like a stone Carry  on May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground Carry  on Carry on carry  on So I met up with some friends at the edge of the night at a bar off 75 And we talked and talked about how our parents will die All our neighbors and wives But i'd like to think I can cheat it all to make up for the times i've been cheated on And it's nice to know when i was left for dead I was found and I know not these streets I am not the ghost you want to be If you're lost and alone, or you're sinkin like a stone Carry  on May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground Carry  on ohhhhhhhhhhhhh My head is on fire, but my legs they're fine Lay your clothes down on the floor, close the door, hold the phone show me how, no one's ever gonna stop us tonight    . Cause we are, we are shining stars We are invincible, we are who we are On our darkest day, when we're miles away Sun will come, we will find our way home If you're lost and alone, or you're sinkin like a stone Carry  on May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground Carry  on Carry on carry on Carry on carry on"
