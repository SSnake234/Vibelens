Just gonna stand there and hear me cry, But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight High off of love, drunk from my hate, it's like I'm huffin' paint and I love it, the more I suffer, I suffocate And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates Where you going? I'm leaving you. No you ain't, Come back. We're running right back, here we go again, it's so insane But when and it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed, I snap \"Who's that dude?\", I don't even know his name I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again Just gonna stand there and watch me burn, But that's alright because I like the way it hurts. Just gonna stand there and hear me cry, But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie I love the way you lie You ever love somebody so much, you can barely breathe when you with 'em? You meet, and neither one of you even know it hit 'em Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills used to get 'em You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em Now you're in each other's face spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em It's the face that's the culprit, controls you both So they say, you'd best to go your separate ways Guess that they don't know ya cuz today, that was yesterday, Sound like broken records playing over but you promised her, next time you'd show restraint, you don't get another chance Life is no nintendo game, but you lied again Just gonna stand there and watch me burn, But that's alright because I like the way it hurts. Just gonna stand there and hear me cry, But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie I love the way you lie Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean And we fall back into the same patterns, same routine But your temper's just as bad as mine is; you're the same as me Baby please come back, it wasn't you. Baby it was me, Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk? Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball Next time? There won't be no next time I apologize, even though I know it's lies I'm tired of the games, I just want her back. I know I'm a liar, Stand there and watch me burn, But that's alright because I like the way it hurts. Just gonna stand there and hear me cry, But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie I love the way you lie"
