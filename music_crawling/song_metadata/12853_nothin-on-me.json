Right person found at the wrong time In this case, glad I found you 'cause I know that you are mine I know it ain't of ficial, but it's 'bout to be soon Show everyone we don't care what they think about it too I never thought that we would make it this far We were just vibin' now look at where we are Got so much po tential, we got something so special Like where this is going, keep this thing flowing Ain't got nothin' on me, these people do not phase me Enjoying every moment, ain't worried 'bout who's in it I'm growing every day, everything's gon' be o kay As long I got my * together, they gon' see me doin' better Ain't got nothin' on me, these people do not phase me Enjoying every moment, ain't worried 'bout who's in it I'm growing every day, everything's gon' be o kay As long I got my * together, they gon' see me doin' better Ain't got nothin' on me, on me, on me (These people) Ain't got nothin' on me, on me, on me Ain't got nothin' on me, on me, on me Nothin' on me, baby"
