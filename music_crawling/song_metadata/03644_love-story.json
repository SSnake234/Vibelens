  "lyrics": "Where do I begin to tell the story of how great a love can be The sweet love story that is older than the sea The simple truth about the love she brings to me where do I start With her first hello she gave a meaning to this empty world of mine There'd never be another love another time She came into my life and made the living fine she fills my heart She fills my heart with very special things With angel songs, with wild i maginings she fills my soul with so much love That any where I go I'm never lonely with her a long who could be lonely I reach for her hand it's always there How long does it last can love be measured by the hours in a day I have no answers now but this much I can say I know I'll need her until the stars all burn away and she'll be there"
