  "lyrics": "When ever sang my songs On the stage , on my own When ever said my words Wishing they would be heard I saw you smiling at me Was it real or just my fantasy You'd always be there in the corner Of this ti ny little bar Did you ever know That I had mine on you? Darling, so there you are With that look on your face As if you're never hurt As if you're never down Shall I be the one for you Who pinches you softly but sure If frown is shown then I will know that you are no dreamer You will know that you're not dreaming "
