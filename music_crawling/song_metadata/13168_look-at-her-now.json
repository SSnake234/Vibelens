Watch her go Mmm mmm mmm. Wow... Look at her now Mmm mmm mmm.... ...Look at her now. Watch her go Mmm mmm mmm. Wow... Look at her now Fast nights that got him That new life was his problem Not saying she was perfect Still regrets that moment Like that night wasn’t wrong, wasn’t right yeah What a thing to be human made her more of woman Of course she was sad But now she’s glad she dodged a bullet Took a few years to soak up the tears Mmm mmm mmm.... ...Look at her now. Watch her go Mmm mmm mmm. Wow... Look at her now Mmm mmm mmm.... ...Look at her now. Watch her go Mmm mmm mmm. Wow... Look at her now She knows she’ll find love only if she wants it She knows she’ll find love Uhh She knows she’ll find love. Only if she wants it She knows she’ll find love. On the up from the way down She knows she’ll find love only if she wants it She knows she’ll find love Uhh She knows she’ll find love. Only if she wants it She knows she’ll find love. On the up from the way down"
