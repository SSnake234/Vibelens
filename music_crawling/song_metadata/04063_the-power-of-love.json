  "lyrics": "The whispers in the morning of lovers sleeping tight Are rolling like thunder now as I look in your eyes I hold on to your body and feel each move you make Your voice is warm and tender a love that I could not forsake 'Cause I am your lady , and you are my man Whenever you reach for me , I'll do all that I can Even though there may be times . It seems I'm far away (But) Never wonder where I am 'Cause I am always by your side 'Cause I am your lady , and you are my man Whenever you reach for me , I'll do all that I can We're heading for something, somewhere I've never been Sometimes I am frightened , but I'm ready to learn ('Bout) Of the power of love The sound of your heart beat ing made it clear suddenly The feel ing that I can't go on is light years away"
