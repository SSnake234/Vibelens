  "lyrics": "Who knows the day when we would fall apart? Standing in the rain with my broken heart I'd still feel your lips in my memories Nothing would fade It'd be a lie to say I ain't worried That I'd lose you when I love u the most For love is so vague for our hands are weak Oh baby don't u know? I would love u more than words that I can say I would trade all my life to be with you When the night falls slowly, I'd be lost without u Oh what else could i do?﻿ Who knows the day when we would fall apart? Standing in the rain with my broken heart I'd still feel your lips in my memories Nothing would fade It'd be a lie to say I ain't worried That I'd lose you when I love u the most For love is so vague for our hands are weak Oh baby don't u know? Baby don't let go, because I love you so For the rest of my life, my only love When you feel so lonely, oh baby don't you cry ? Don't you know I love you ? Baby take my hand, until the very end To the heaven or hell, with you I stand Where our love can grow old, where there are just us two Where I can be with you Don't you know I love you?"
