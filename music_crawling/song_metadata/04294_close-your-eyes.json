  "lyrics": "tomorrow morning I have to leave, but forever I may be Best believe I'm thinking of you, I canґt believe how much I love you Oh yeah this is tonight, we donґt wanna waste this time Give me something to remember, baby put your lips on mine And I love you forever Anytime when we find ourselves apart If You just close your eyes, and youґll be here with me Just slip to your heart, and that’s where I'll be If you just close your eyes, till you drifted away You never be too far, from me If you close your eyes, just close your eyes I know Iґm gonna see you again, promise me that you wonґt forget Cause as long as you remember, a part of us will be together So even youґre fast asleep, look for me inside your dream Canґt believe it didnґt what weґre sharing, but even when Iґm not there to tell you That I, I love, love you forever Anytime when I canґt be where you are If You just close your eyes, and youґll be here with me Just slip to your heart, and that’s where I'll be If you just close your eyes, till you drifted away You never be too far, from me If you close your eyes, just close your eyes Is there anywhere that far Any time you feeling low Is there anywhere my love cannot reach for more I could be anywhere on earth, It could be anywhere I'll be Oh baby if you wanna see CHORUS: (lên tone ) You just close your eyes Just close your eyes, and you'll be here with me Look to your heart, and that’s where Iґll be Close your eyes, till you drifted away You never be too far, from me You just close your eyes Just close your eyes, and you'll be here with me Look to your heart, and that’s where Iґll be Close your eyes, till you drifted away You never be too far, from me just close your eyes just close your eyes "
