  "lyrics": "    It can't be said I'm an early bird It's 10 o' clock be fore I say a word Baby, I can never tell How do you sleep so well? You keep tellin' me to live right To go to bed before the daylight But then you wake up for the sunrise You know you don't gotta pre tend Baby, now and then Don't you just wanna wake up, dark as a lake Smel ling like a bonfire, lost in a haze? If you're drunk on life, babe, I think it's great But while in this world I think I'll take my whiskey neat My coffee black and my bed at three You're too sweet for me You're too sweet for me I take my whiskеy neat My coffee black and my bed at three You're too sweet for me You're too sweet for me Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh Ooh- ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh Ooh- ooh- ooh ooh-ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh I aim low I aim true, and the ground's where I go I work late where I'm free from the phone But you worry some, I know But who wants to live for ever, babe? You treat your mouth as if it's Heaven's gate The rest of you like you're the TSA I wish I could go along Babe, don't get me wrong You know you're bright as the morning, as soft as the rain Pret ty as a vine, as sweet as a grape If you can sit in a barrel, maybe I'll wait Until that day I'd rather take my whiskey neat My coffee black and my bed at three You're too sweet for me You're too sweet for me I take my whiskеy neat My coffee black and my bed at three You're too sweet for me You're too sweet for me Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh Ooh- ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh Ooh- ooh- ooh ooh-ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh Ooh- ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh Ooh- ooh- ooh ooh-ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh I take my whiskеy neat My coffee black and my bed at three You're too sweet for me You're too sweet for me"
