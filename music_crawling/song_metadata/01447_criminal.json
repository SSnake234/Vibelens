  "lyrics": " He is a hustler He's no good at all He is a loser, he's a bum, bum, bum, He lies, he bluffs whHe's unreliable. He is a sucker with a gun, gun, gun, gun I know you told me I should stay away I know you said He's just a dog astray. He is a rebel with a tainted heart And even I know this ain't smart But mama im in love with a criminal And this type of love Isn't rational, it's physical Mama please don't cry I will be alright All reasons inside I just cant deny Love the guy He is a villain of the devil's law He is a killer just for fun, fun, fun, fun That man's a snitch and unpredic table, He's got no conscious He got none, none, none, none All I know, should let go, but no 'cause he's a rebel with a tain ted heart And even I know this ain't smart But mama im in love with a criminal And this type of love Isn't rational, it's physical Mama please don't cry I will be alright All reasons inside I just cant deny Love the guy And he's got my name Tatooed on his arm So I guess its okay He's with me And I hear people talk Trying to make remarks But I don't even hear I don't care But mama i'm in love with a criminal And this type of love Isn't rational, it's physical Mama please don't cry I will be alright All reasons inside I just cant deny Love the guy"
