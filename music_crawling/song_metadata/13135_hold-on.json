Tone I never wanted it to break I thought we put it all be hind us Ever since that day All I want to do is find us Now I’m falling down I’m falling down wi thout you So I’m calling out I’m calling out to find you You gotta hold on to what you got babe It ain’t always greener on the other side ya know We ain't rich but we worth a lot babe I wanna see the world with your hand in mine ya know Come on I’ll love you like that It ain’t always greener on the other side ya know Come on I’ll love you like that I wanna see the world with your hand in mine ya know Hold back hold back hold back Even when I made mis takes You would always bring me higher We got caught up in our ways Like the time we at the bonfire There was no one else No one else to run to So I’m calling out Calling out to find you You gotta hold on to what you got babe It ain’t always greener on the other side ya know We ain't rich but we worth a lot babe I wanna see the world with your hand in mine ya know Come on I’ll love you like that It ain’t always greener on the other side ya know Come on I’ll love you like that I wanna see the world with your hand in mine ya know  Hold on to what you got babe  Hold on to what you got Yeah I didn’t know just how much I loved you girl Un til you hurled my heart and destroyed my world When we’re apart I’m a perm without a curl Cause ever since the start you’ve been the ocean to my pearl You and I together tilt earth of its axis We make as much sense as a left wing fascist But when we locked eyes back in grade 9 classes I knew we’d be together till this life passes You gotta hold on to what you got babe It ain’t always greener on the other side ya know We ain't rich but we worth a lot babe I wanna see the world with your hand in mine ya know Come on I’ll love you like that It ain’t always greener on the other side ya know Come on I’ll love you like that I wanna see the world with your hand in mine ya gotta hold on to what you got babe It ain’t always greener on the other side ya know We ain't rich but we worth a lot babe I wanna see the world with your hand in mine ya know Come on I’ll love you like that It ain’t always greener on the other side ya know Come on I’ll love you like that I wanna see the world with your hand in mine ya know I’ll love ya love ya love ya like that And I watched you walk away I’ll love ya love ya love ya like that Never wanted it to break I’ll love ya love ya love ya like that And I watched you walk away I’ll love ya love ya love ya like that Never wanted it to break"
