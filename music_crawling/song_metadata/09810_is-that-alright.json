A little boy a little girl Laughing and loving tryin' to figure out the world It felt like summer when I kissed you in the rain And I know your story but tell me again Nothing you say wouldn't interest me I would be honored if you would take me as I am I want you To look right in my eyes To tell me you love me ...To be by my side I want you At the end of my life Wanna see your face when I fall with grace At the moment I die Is that al right? Is that alright? I hope you’re still with me When I’m not quite my self And I pray that you’ll lift me When you know I need help It’s a warm cele bration of all of our years I dream of our story of our fairy tale Family dinners and family trees teachin' the kids to say thank you and please Knowing if we stay together that things will be right I want you To look right in my eyes To tell me you love me ...To be by my side I want you At the end of my life Wanna see your face when I fall with grace At the moment I die Is that al right? Is that alright? Is that al right?"
