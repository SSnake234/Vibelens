  "lyrics": "1. Looking back on younger days, the time has passed And nothing stays the same. Hey hey hey! She was such a pretty girl, with glowing eyes and yellow curls. Hey hey hey! Stars are in a summer night She's wishing that they'd fall down through the atmosphere, for a souvenir She's waiting for her Superman, her Never land Cause he can show the way. Hey hey hey! Where's her missing piece her mind's been chasing, chasing? A bullet with your name, a ticking time grenade You better run away, run away, run away Either way you're screwed, there's nothing you can do You better run away, run away, run away. 2. She's tellin' tales through telephone That make you cry, chill to the bone. Hey hey hey! It's lock and key, electrified, Hide and seek from dirty eyes. Hey hey hey! Driving in the rain to somewhere far But they've got tattoos stamped upon their arms, of her name in hearts She doesn't understand that love is what you give, not given up Hey hey hey! Where's her missing piece her mind's been chasing, chasing? Yeah you better not sleep, because she's waiting, waiting She knows all about you; you're in her aim."
