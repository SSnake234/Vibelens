  "lyrics": "She had a face straight out a magazine God only knows but you'll never leave her Her balac lava is starting to chafe When she gets his gun he's begging, \"Babe stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.\" I'll give him one more tim We'll give you one more fight Said one more line There'll be a riot, cause I know you Now if you never shoot, you'll never know And if you never eat, you'll never grow You've got a pretty kinda dirty face And when you're leaving your home she's begging you, \"Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.\" I'll give him one more tim We'll give you one more fight Said one more line There'll be a riot, cause I know you Well, now that you've got your gun It's much harder now the police have come Now shoot him if it's what you're worth And if you just take off your mask To find out that everything's gone wrong, wrong, wrong. Now everybody's dead And they're driving past my old school And he's got his gun, he's got his suit on She says, 'Babe, you look so cool' You look so cool, you look so cool, cool, cool, cool You look so cool, you look so cool, you look so cool, cool, cool, cool, cool"
