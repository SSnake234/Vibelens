  "lyrics": " Waiting here for someone Only yesterday we were on the run You smile back at me and your face lit up the sun Now I'm waiting here for someone And, oh love until you feel this rough Why's it only you I'm thinking of My shadows dancing Without you for the first time My heart is hoping You'll walk right in tonight Tell me there are things that you regret Cause if I'm being honest I ain't over you yet It's all I'm asking Is it too much to ask?  Is It Too Much To Ask?  Someone's moving outside The lights come on and down the drive I forget you're not here when I close my eyes Do you still think of me sometimes? And, oh love, watch the sun comeing up Don’t it feel fucked we're not in love The shadows dancing Without you for the first time My heart is hoping You'll walk right in tonight Tell me there are things that you regret Cause if I'm being honest I ain't over you yet It's all I'm asking Is it too much to ask?  (x3) The shadows dancing Without you for the first time My heart is hoping You'll walk right in tonight Tell me there are things that you regret Cause if I'm being honest I ain't over you yet It's all I'm asking Is it too much to ask? The shadows dancing Without you for the first time My heart is hoping You'll walk right in tonight Tell me there are things that you regret Cause if I'm being honest I ain't over you yet It's all I'm asking Is it too much to ask? It's all I'm asking Is it too much to ask? It's all I'm asking Is it too much to ask?"
