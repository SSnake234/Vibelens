  "lyrics": " Seven years and fifty days The time is passing by Nothing in this world could be As nice as you and I And how could we break up like this And how could we be wrong So many years, so many days And I still sing my song Now I run to you Like I always do When I close my eyes I think of you Such a lonely girl Such a lonely world When I close my eyes I'll return to you Like I always do When I close my eyes I think of you Such a lonely girl Such a lonely world When I close my eyes I dream of you Seven years and fifty days Now just look at me Am I like what I used to be So then what do you see And how could we break up like this And how could we be wrong So many years, so many days And I still sing my song Now I run to you Like I always do When I close my eyes I think of you Such a lonely girl Such a lonely world When I close my eyes I'll return to you Like I always do When I close my eyes I think of you Such a lonely girl Such a lonely world When I close my eyes I dream of you We had joy, we had fun, we had Seasons in the sun But the wine and the song, like the Seasons, have all gone"
