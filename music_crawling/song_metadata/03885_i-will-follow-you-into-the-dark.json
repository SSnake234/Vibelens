If heaven and hell decide that they both are satis fied, illuminate the noes on their vacancy signs. If there's no one be side you when your soul embarks then I'll follow you into the dark. If heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied, If heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied,"
