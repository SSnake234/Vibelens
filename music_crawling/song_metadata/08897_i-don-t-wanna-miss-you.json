It's late at night It's always late at night when these things happen Feelings happen And it's cold tonight And I hope you're havin' a good time at your place Deep down it's all a lie That I hope you're happy No, I hope you're not happy without me And I hope you're fine No, I'm hoping you're crying actually Say I hope you're happy No, I'm hoping you're not happy without me I hope you're fine No, I'm hoping you're crying over me I don't wanna miss you Cause we're through I don't think that I'd miss you I don't think that I'd know what I'm thinking I don't wanna text you Cause we are through I don't think that I'd call you I don't think that I'd know what I'm thinking So I went down the refrigerator Got the munchies and I'm off the radar Soothing down the pain tonight But I know that I'd be lyin' with my mind full of good ol' times And sometimes I think about you Times you spent with me Then I hope you're happy, again I'm always lying I hope when she's asleep you'd think about me I don't wanna miss you Cause we are through I don't think that I'd miss you I don't think that I'd know what I'm thinking I don't wanna text you Cause we are through I don't think that I'd call you I don't think that I'd know what I'm thinking"
