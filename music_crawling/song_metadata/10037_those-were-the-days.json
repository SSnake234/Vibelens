  "lyrics": "Once upon a time there was a tavern Where we used to raise a glass or two Remember how we laughed away the hours Think about the great things we would do Those were the days my friend we thought they'd never end We'd sing and dance forever and a day We'd live the life we choose. We'd fight and never lose For we were young and sure to have our way. Just tonight I stood before the tavern Nothing seemed the way it used to be In the glass I saw a strange re flection Was that lonely woman really me Those were the days my friend we thought they'd never end We'd sing and dance forever and a day We'd live the life we choose. We'd fight and never lose For we were young and sure to have our way. Through the door there came familiar laughter I saw your face and heard you call my name Oh my friend we're older but no wiser For in our hearts the dreams are still the same Those were the days my friend we thought they'd never end We'd sing and dance forever and a day We'd live the life we choose. We'd fight and never lose For we were young and sure to have our way."
