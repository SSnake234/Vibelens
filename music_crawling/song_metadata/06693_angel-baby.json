  "lyrics": "I need a lover to keep me sane Pull me from hell bring me back again Play me the classics, something romantic Give him my all when I don't even have it I always dreamed of a solemn face Someone who feels like a holiday But now I'm in pieces, barely believing Starting to think that I've lost all feeling You came out the blue on a rainy night, no lie I tell you how I almost died, while you're bringing me back to life I just wanna live in this moment fo rever 'Cause I'm afraid that living couldn't gеt any better Started giving up on thе word \"fo rever\" Until you gave up heaven so we could be to gether You're my angel, angel baby Angel, you're my angel Baby. Baby, you're my angel, angel baby I'll fall in love with the little things Counting the tattoos on your skin Tell me a secret and baby I'll keep it And maybe we can play house for the weekend You came out the blue on a rainy night, no lie I tell you how I almost died, while you're bringing me back to life I just wanna live in this moment fo rever 'Cause I'm afraid that living couldn't gеt any better Started giving up on thе word \"fo rever\" Until you gave up heaven so we could be to gether You're my angel, angel baby Angel, you're my angel Baby. Baby, you're my angel, angel baby All the sick and twisted nights that I've been waiting for ya They were worth it all a long, yeah I just wanna live in this moment fo rever 'Cause I'm afraid that living couldn't gеt any better Started giving up on thе word \"fo rever\" Until you gave up heaven so we could be to gether You're my angel, angel baby Angel, you're my angel Baby. Baby, you're my angel, angel baby You're my angel, angel baby Angel, you're my angel Baby. Baby, you're my angel, angel baby"
