Could roses bloom ? Again retrace my lips erase your touch It's all too much for me Blow away like smoke in air How can you die carelessly Our love is six feet under I can’t help but wonder If our grave was watered by the rain Would roses bloom ? Could roses bloom ? They're playing us out, layin us down tonight And all of these clouds crying us back to life But you're cold as a knife six feet under I can’t help but wonder If our grave was watered by the rain Bloom Bloom Again Help I lost myself again But I remember you "
