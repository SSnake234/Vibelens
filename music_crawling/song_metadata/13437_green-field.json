Gre en fields are gone now parch ed by the s un Gone from the val leys where ri vers used to r un Go ne with the cold wind that swe pt into my hear t Go ne with the lo ver who let th eir dreams de part Wh ere are the gr een fields that w e use d to ro am ** * I’ll never know wh at made you ru n away Ho w can I keep searching when da rk clouds hide the day I o nly know there’s noth ing here for me Not hing in this w ide world left for me to s ee But I’l l keep on wa iting t ill you ret urn I’ll keep on waiti ng unti l the day you lear n Yo u can’t be hap py while your h earts on the roa m Y ou can’t be ha ppy until you bring it ho me Home to the gree n fields and m e onc e aga in."
