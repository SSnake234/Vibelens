How did I fall in love with you? ..I hear your voice and I start to tremble Bring back the child that, I resemble I cannot pretend, that we can still be friend Don't want to be alone tonight What can I do to make you mine Fallen so hard, so fast this time What did I say, what did you do? How did I fall in love with you … Oh I want to say this right, and it has to be tonight Just need you to know ohhh... I don't want to live this life, I don't want to say goodbye With you I wanna spend the rest of my life... … What can I do to make you mine Fallen so hard, so fast this time What did I say, what did you do? How did I fall in love with you What can I do to make you mine Fallen so hard, so fast this time Everything changed we never knew . How did I fall in love with you."
