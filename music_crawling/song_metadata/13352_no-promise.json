I don't wanna run away, baby you're the one I need tonight, No promises. Baby, now I need to hold you tight, I just wanna die in your  arms Hey baby, when we are together, doing things that we love. Everytime you're near I feel like I'm in heaven, feeling high I don't want to let go, girl. I just need you you to know girl. I don't want to run away, I want to stay forever, thru Time and Time.. No promises I don't wanna run away, I don't wanna be alone No Promises Baby, now I need to hold you tight, now and forever my love No promises I don't wanna run away, baby you're the one I need tonight, No promises. Baby, now I need to hold you tight, I just wanna die in your arms Here tonight"
