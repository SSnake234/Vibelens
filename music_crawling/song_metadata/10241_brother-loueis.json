Girl, this game can't last forever, why, we cannot live together? Try, don't let him take your love from me, CHORUS 1 : You're no good, can't you see, Brother Louie, Louie, Louie, I'm in love - set you free, oh, she's only looking to me. Only love breaks her heart, Brother Louie, Louie, Louie, only love's paradise, oh, she's only looking to me. CHORUS 2 :Brother Louie, Louie, Louie, oh, she's only looking to me Oh, let it, Louie, she is under cover. Brother Louie, Louie, Louie, oh, doing what he's doing, so, leave it Louie, 'cause I'm her lover. 2. Stay , 'cause this boy wants to gamble, stay, love is more than he can handle, girl, come on, stay by me forever, ever. Why does he go on pretending that his love is never ending, babe, don't let him steal your love from me."
