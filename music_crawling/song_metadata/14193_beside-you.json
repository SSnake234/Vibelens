Don't lie, baby don't lie His love never felt right Switch sides and I'm beside ya If you say it's alright * (rải nhẹ) Don't lie, baby don't lie His love never felt right Switch sides and I'm beside ya If you say it's alright hmmm Your skin, so fine Come close baby put it on mine Your skin, so fine Come close baby put it on mine Huooooo Don't lie, baby don't lie His love never felt right Switch sides and I'm beside ya If you say it's alright hmmmm"
