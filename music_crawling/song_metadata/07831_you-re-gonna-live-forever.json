  "lyrics": "    A great big bang and dinosaurs Fiery rain and meteors It all ends unfortunately But you're gonna live forever in me I guarantee, just wait and see Parts of me were made by you And planets keep their distance too The moon's got a grip on the sea And you're gonna live forever in me I guarantee, it's your destiny Life is full of sweet mistakes And love's an honest one to make Time leaves no fruit on the tree But you're gonna live forever in me I guarantee, it's just meant to be    And when the pastor asks the pews for reasons he can't marry you I'll keep my word and my seat But you're gonna live forever in me I guarantee, just wait and see"
