  "lyrics": "Not sure if you know this But when we first met I got so nervous I couldn't speak In that very moment I found the one and My life had found its missing piece So as long as I live I'll love you Will have and hold you You look so beautiful in white And from now til my very last breath This day i'll cherish You look so beautiful in white to- night  What we have is timeless My love is endless And with this ring I say to the world You're my every reason You're all that I believe in With all my heart I mean every word. So as long as I live I'll love you Will have and hold you You look so beautiful in white And from now til my very last breath This day i'll cherish You look so beautiful in white to- night Key changed up 1 tone to --------- Ohh ohh You look so beautiful in white tonight  … Na na na na So beautiful in white to- night And if a daughter is what our future holds I hope she has your eyes Finds love like you and I did And when she falls in love we'll let her go And i'll walk her down the aisle She'll look so beautiful in white You look so beautiful in white Key changed up 1 tone to --------- So as long as I live I'll love you Will have and hold you You look so beautiful in white And from now til my very last breath This day i'll cherish You look so beautiful in white to- night"
