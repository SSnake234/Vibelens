  "lyrics": "Tone We used to run red lights and never look back We used to chase long nights, nothing wrong with that 'Cause I loved you and I lost my mind And now, I try to leave it, oh, I try But you still haunt me no matter where I go And you hated my la sagna but you came back for more You got me running circles in your favorite store And I lost you and I lost my mind And now, I try to leave it all behind But I still see you no matter where I go If I could turn back time and make it all alright Only a piece of you and me will keep me warm all night If I could turn back time and rewrite every line If only I could, but baby, I can't So I'mma scream, shout, let all out And scream and shout and let it all out for you, for you So I'mma scream, shout, let all out And scream and shout and let it all out for you, for you I hit you up like, \" Hey girl, can we talk right now? I know you're far aw ay, girl, can we hang right now?\" 'Cause I loved you and I lost my mind And now, I t ry to leave it all behind But I still see you no matter where I go I know it's getting late, girl, I don't care right now I tried to call you on the phone, girl, but you don't pick up And I lost you and I lost my mind Now, I'm tryna leave it, oh, I'm trying But you still haunt me no matter where I go If I could turn back time and make it all alright Only a piece of you and me will keep me warm all night If I could turn back time and rewrite every line If only I could, but baby, I can't So I'mma scream, shout, let all out And scream and shout and let it all out for you, for you So I'mma scream, shout, let all out And scream and shout and let it all out for you, for you Maybe it's a mistake if we let the clock break Everything in my mind, everything in my mind is telling me That it's a mistake and it ends in heartbreak Everything in my mind, everything in my mind is telling me To try to turn back time and make it all alright Only a piece of you and me will keep me warm all night If I could turn back time and rewrite every line If only I could, but baby, I can't So I'mma scream, shout, let all out And scream and shout and let it all out for you, for you So I'mma scream, shout, let all out And scream and shout and let it all out for you, for you"
