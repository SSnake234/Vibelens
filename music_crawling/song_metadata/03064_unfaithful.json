  "lyrics": "Story of my life.. Searching for the right But it keeps avoiding me.. Sorrow in my soul Cause it seems that wrong.. Really loves my company He's more than a man.. And this is more than love The reason that the sky is blue.. But clouds are rolling in Because I'm gone again.. And to him I just can't be true And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful.. And it kills him inside To know that I am happy with some other guy.. I can see him dying I don't wanna do this anymore. I don't wanna be the reason why Everytime I walk out the door. I see him die a little more inside I don't wanna hurt him anymore. I don't wanna take away his life I don't wanna be...A murderer Our love.. his trust! I might as well take a gun and put it to.. his head..get it over with.. I don't wanna do this.. anymore"
