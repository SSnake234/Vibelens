I'll give my life up fo r you, Cos you are my dr eam. A nd baby, everything that I have is yours, I'l l be there when you're insecure, Let you know that you're always lo vely. Girl, cos you are the only thin g that I got right now O ne day when the sky is falling, I'll be standing right ne xt to you, Right n ext to you. N othing will ever come between us, O h nah nah Stand by my side When the s ky falls I'l l be there Y ou've got that smile, That only heave n can make. I pray to God ev eryday, To keep yo u forever."
