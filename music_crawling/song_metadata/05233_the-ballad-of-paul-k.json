  "lyrics": "He's drinking cold Corona Feels like is getting older Now and noticing how he's finding Grey hairs left in the shower Tattoos fade by the hour And he can't understand these feelings Why life is getting him down He used to smile now he frowns And cries inside Its been this way for a while And he can't seem to put things right When life has been unkin d And you' re losing your mind Look in the mirror afraid of what you'll find It feels like time's not on your sid e And in the daytime he just sits and watches television shows Dont know why but somehow The ones you love you hate now, You feel down and blue Look at what you've thrown away They stood beside you all the way (there's probably an (A7) chord in there somewhere - you need to experiment) Now its too late, its too late for you"
