  "lyrics": "When the visions around you, Bring tears to your eyes And all that surrounds you, Are secrets and lies I'll be your strength, I'll give you hope, Keeping your faith when it's gone The one you should call, When you're standing here all alone... And I will take You in my arms And hold you right where you belong Till the day my life is through This I promise you This I promise you I've loved you forever, In lifetimes before And I promise you never, Will you hurt anymore I give you my word I give you my heart This is a battle we've won And with this vow, Forever has now begun... Just close your eyes Each loving day (each loving day) And I know this feeling won't go away Till the day my life is through This I promise you ooh I promise you Over and over I fall When I hear you call Without you in my life baby I just wouldn't be living at all And I will take You in my arms And hold you right where you belong Till the day my life is through This I promise you Just close your eyes Each loving day (each loving day) And I know this feeling won't go away Every word i say is true This I promise you Every word I say is true. This I promise you Ooh, I promise you..."
