  "lyrics": "Intro:  Often I am upset that I cannot fall in love but I guess This avoids the stress of falling out of it Are you tired of me yet? I'm a little sick right now but I swear When I'm ready I will fly us out of here Ooo oo oo, I'll cut my hair Ooo oo oo, To make you stare Ooo oo oo, I'll hide my chest And I'll figure out a way to get us out of here Ooo oo oo x Turn off your porcelain face, I can't really think right now and this place Has too many colors enough to drive all of us insane Are you dead? Sometimes I think I'm dead Cause I can feel ghosts and ghouls wrapping my head But I don't wanna fall asleep just yet Ooo oo oo, My eyes went dark Ooo oo oo, I don't know where Ooo oo oo, My pupils are But I'll figure out a way to get us out of here Get a load of this monster He doesn't know how to communicate His mind is in a different place Will everybody please give him a little bit of space Get a load of this trainwreck His hair's a mess and he doesn't know who he is yet But little do we know , the stars Welcome him with open arms Ooo oo oo, Time is Ooo oo oo, Slowly Ooo oo oo, Tracing his face But strangely he feels at home in this place"
