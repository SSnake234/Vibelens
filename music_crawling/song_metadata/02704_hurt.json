  "lyrics": "I hurt myself today  to see if I still feel I focus on the pain  the only thing that's real The needle tears a hole  the old familiar sting Try to kill it all away  but I remember everything What have I become?  My sweetest friend Everyone I know  goes away in the end And you could have it all  My empire of dirt I will let you down  I will make you hurt I wear this crown of thorns upon my liars chair Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair Beneath the stains of time  the feeling disappears You are someone else  I am still right here What have I become?  My sweetest friend Everyone I know  goes away in the end"
