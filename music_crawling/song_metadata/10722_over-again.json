  "lyrics": "  x2 Said I'd never leave her cause her hands fit like my t-shirt ...Tounge tied over three words, cursed ...Running over thoughts that make my feet hurt Bodies intertwined with her lips Now she's feeling so low since she went solo Hole the middle of my heart like a polo And it's no joke to me So can we do it all over again? If you're pretending from the start Like this , with a tight grip, then my kiss Can mend your broken heart I might miss everything you said to me And I could lend you broken parts That might fit like this And I would give you all my heart So we could start it all over again Can we take the same road? Two days in the same clothes And I know just what she'll say if I can make all this pain go ...Can we stop this for a minute? You know, I can tell that your heart isn't in it, or with it Tell me with your mind, body and spirit I can make your tears fall down like the showers that are British Whether we're together or apart We can both remove the masks and admit that we regret it from the start If you're pretending from the start Like this, with a tight grip, then my kiss Can mend your broken heart I might miss everything you said to me And I could lend you broken parts That might fit like this And I would give you all my heart So we could start it all over again ...You'll never know how to make it on your own ...And you'll never show weakness for letting go ...I guess you're still hurt if this is over But do you really want to be alone? If you're pretending from the start Like this , with a tight grip, then my kiss Can mend your broken heart I might miss everything you said to me And I could lend you broken parts That might fit like this And I would give you all my heart So we could start it all over again If you're pretending from the start Like this , with a tight grip, then my kiss Can mend your broken heart I might miss everything you said to me And I could lend you broken parts That might fit like this And I would give you all my heart So we could start it all over again"
