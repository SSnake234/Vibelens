Y ou're vain, your games, you're insecure You love me, you like h er You make me laugh, you make me cry I don't know which side to b uy Y our friends they're jerks A nd when you act like them, just know i t hurts I wanna be with the one I k now And the 7th thing I hate the most that you d o C ompared to all the great things I pr obably should mention The 7 tha t I like"
