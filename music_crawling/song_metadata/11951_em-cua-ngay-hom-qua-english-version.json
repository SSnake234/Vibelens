  "lyrics": "Don't stare at me in that way It's not you of yesterday Because you changed, you went away so far away Since the day you left me here alone I can't breathe, yes i did I can't breathe cause you were ruthless baby. Don't need to rush, just be yourself of yesterday Uh Uh Uh Uh Just be yourself of yesterday Uh Uh Uh Uh Don't leave me here alone tonight Uh Uh Uh Uh I'm going down, i'm broken heart Uh Uh Uh Uh. April 28th I'm thinking back and looking out through the door You showed me a perfect future Cause you know that i'm a dreamer Damn it• Just go away dont be here anymore You make me black and blue it's enough Don't try to be a stronger, girl Alright... Go away... Just close your eyes and think back You just lived for your illusions... That's right baby? I set a fire in my heart, it wasn't burnt because of you The truth's embracing my mind."
