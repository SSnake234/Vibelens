  "lyrics": " Met you by surprise, I didn't realize That my life would change forever Saw you standing there, I didn't know I cared There was something special in the air. Dreams are my reali ty The only kind of real fantasy Illusions are a common thing I try to live in dreams It seems as if it's meant to be. Dreams are my reali ty A different kind of reality I dream of loving in the night And loving seems alright Although it's only fantasy . If you do exist, honey don't resist Show me a new way of loving Tell me that it's true, show me what to do I feel something s pecial about yo u. Met you by surprise, I didn't realize That my life would change forever Tell me that it's true, Feelings that are cue I feel something special about you."
