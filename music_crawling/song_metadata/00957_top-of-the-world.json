  "lyrics": " Such a feelin's comin' over me There is wonder in most every thing I see.... Not a cloud in the sky Got the sun in my eyes And I ...won't be surp rised if it's a dream..... Everything I want the world to be Is now coming true es pecial ly for me And the reason is clear.. It's be cause you are here You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen I'm on the top of the world lookin' ....down on creation And the only expla nation I can find.... Is the love that I've found ever since you've been a round Your love's put me at the top of the world..... Something in the wind has learned my name And it's tellin' me that things are not the same In the leaves on the trees And the touch of the breeze There's a pleasin' sense of happiness for me_____ There is only one wish on my mind When this day is through I hope that I will find That to morrow will be Just the same for you and me All I need will be mine if you are here_____"
