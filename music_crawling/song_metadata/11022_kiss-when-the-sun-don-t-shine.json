  "lyrics": "Every friday my head's spinnin' round and round Been workin' all week now, baby Yes it's my day I take a trip down town To my favourite club now, baby That's when I see you With loving arms to fall into But I'm not looking for full time love There's still so much I wanna do I only kiss kiss kiss. When the sun don't shine Oh oh oh! Oh oh oh! You wanna kiss kiss kiss then tonight is fine Oh oh oh! Oh oh oh! Can live with out it I don't want a full time love Cause it's not on my mind now, babe You know my freedom Is what I'm thinking of And I ain't got the time now, baby Straight out of the blue You came and asked me to Be your date in the daytime, babe But I am sorry no can do I only kiss kiss kiss. When the sun don't shine Oh oh oh! Oh oh oh! You wanna kiss kiss kiss then tonight is fine Oh oh oh! Oh oh oh! I only kiss kiss kiss. When the sun don't shine Oh oh oh! Oh oh oh! You wanna kiss kiss kiss then tonight is fine Oh oh oh! Oh oh oh! Kiss me. When the sun don't shine Kiss me. When the sun don't shine Oh oh oh! Make some noise for the Venga boys Oh oh oh! Make some noise for the Venga boys Shalala lalala lala lalala lala lalala Shalala lalala lala lalala lala lalala I only kiss kiss kiss. When the sun don't shine Oh oh oh! Oh oh oh! You wanna kiss kiss kiss then tonight is fine Oh oh oh! Oh oh oh! I only kiss kiss kiss. When the sun don't shine Oh oh oh! Oh oh oh! You wanna kiss kiss kiss then tonight is fine Oh oh oh! Oh oh oh!"
