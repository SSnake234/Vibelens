Tell me Do you feel the love? Spend the summer of a lifetime with me L L et me take you to the place of your dreams Tell me Do you feel the love? Ooh, oo oo h  And I could say I never answered those believers inside my head But that's far from the truth Don't know what's come over me I I t seems like yesterday when I said “We'll be friends forever” Constellations of stars Murals on city walls I don't see nobody but you You're my vice, you're my muse You're a nineties floor view I don't see nobody but you Boy, you got me hooked on to something Who could say that they saw us coming? Tell me Do you feel the love? Spend the summer of a lifetime with me Let me take you to the place of your dreams Tell me Do you feel the love? Boy, you got me hooked on to something Who could say that they saw us coming? Tell me Do you feel the love? Spend the summer of a lifetime with me Let me take you to the place of your dreams Tell me Do you feel the love? Do you feel the love? Do you feel the love? Do you feel the love? Do you feel the love?"
