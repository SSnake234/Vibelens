  "lyrics": "Key: Our secret moments in a crowded room They've got no idea about me and you There is an indentation in the shape of you Made your mark on me, a golden tattoo All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation My hands are shaking from holding back from you, ah , ah, ah All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting My hands are shaking afrom all this, ah, ah, ah...ahh... Say my name and everything just stops I don’t want you like a best friend Only bought this dress so you could take it off Carve your name into my bedpost 'Cause I don't want you like a best friend Only bought this dress so you could take it off Take it off ah, ah, ah..ahh... Inescapable And if I get burned At least we were electrified I'm spilling wine in the bathtub Everyone thinks that they know us All of this silence and patience Pining and anticipation My hands are shaking from holding back from you, ah, ah, ah All of this silence and patience Pining and desperately waiting My hands are shaking from all this ah, ah, ah...ahh... Say my name and everything just stops I don't want you like a best friend Only bought this dress so you could take it off Carve your name into my bedpost 'Cause I don't want you like a best friend Only bought this dress so you could take it off Take it off ah, ah, ah...ahh... Ah..ahh, ah...ahh, ah, ah, ah...ahh... Only bought this dress so you could take it off Take it off, ah, ah, ah... ahh... Only bought this dress so you could take it off Flashback when you met me Your buzz cut and my hair bleached Even in my worst times You could see the best of me Flashback to my mistakes My rebounds, my earthquakes Even in my worst lies You saw the truth of me And I woke up just in time Now I wake up by your side My one and only, my lifeline I woke up just in time Now I wake up by your side My hands shakes Say my name and everything just stops I don't want you like a best friend Only bought this dress so you could take it off Carve your name into my bedpost 'Cause I don’t want you like a best friend Only bought this dress so you could take it off Take it off ah, ah, ah...ahh... There is an indentation In the shape of you ( Only bought this dress so you could take it off) Made your mark on me golden tattoo ( Only bought this dress so you could take it off)"
