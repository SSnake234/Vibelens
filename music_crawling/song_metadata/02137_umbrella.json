  "lyrics": "You had my heart, and we'll never be world apart Maybe in magazines, but you'll still be my star Baby cause in the Dark, You can see shiny Cars And that's when you need me there With you I'll always share Because When the sun shines We’ll shine together Told you I'll be here forever That I'll always be your friend Took an oath Imma stick it out 'till the end Now that it's raining more than ever Know that we still have each other You can stand under my Umbrella You can stand under my Umbrella (Ella ella eh eh eh) Under my umbrella (ella ella eh eh eh) Under my umbrella (ella ella eh eh eh) Under my umbrella (ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh)"
