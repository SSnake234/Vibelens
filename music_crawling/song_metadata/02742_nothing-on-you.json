  "lyrics": "If I told you I was perfect I'd be lying, If there's somethin I'm not doin girl I'm tryin'. I know I'm no angel. But I'm not so bad... No, no, no, If you see me at the party conversating That doesn't mean telephone numbers are exchangin'. I know I'm no angel, girl. But I'm not so bad... You should know theres Beautiful girls all over the world I could be chasing. But my time would be wasted, They got nothing on you, baby Nothing on you, baby They might say hi, and I might say hey But you shouldn't worry, about what they say 'Cause they got nothing on you, baby Nothing on you, baby"
