  "lyrics": "We don't talk anymore We don't talk anymore We don't talk anymore Like we used to do We don't love anymore What was all of it for? Oh, we don't talk anymore I just heard you found the one you've been looking You've been looking for I wish I would have known that wasn't me Cause even after all this time I still wonder Why I can't move on Just the way you did so easily Don't wanna know What kind of dress you're wearing tonight If he's holding onto you so tight The way I did before I overdosed Should've known your love was a game Now I can't get you out of my brain I hate you I love you I hate that I love you Don't want to, but I can't put Nobody else above you I hate you I love you I hate that I want you You want her, you need her And I'll never be her I just hope you're lying next to somebody Who knows how to love you like me There must be a good reason that you're gone Every now and then I think you Might want me to come show up at your door But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong Don't wanna know If you're looking into her eyes If she's holding onto you so tight the way I did before I overdosed Now I can't get you out of my brain I hate you I love you I hate that I love you Don't want to, but I can't put Nobody else above you I hate you I love you I hate that I want you You want her, you need her And I'll never be her....."
