I remember you told me That it made you believe in No man, no cry Maybe that's why Every little thing I do Never seems enough for you You don't wanna lose it again But I'm not like them Baby, when you fina - lly Get to love somebo - dy Guess what It's gonna be me.. You've got no choice, babe But to move on, and you know There ain't no time to waste You're just too blind, too see But in the end, ya know it's gonna be me You can't deny, so just tell me why Every little thing I do Never seems enough for you You don't wanna lose it again But I'm not like them Baby, when you fina - lly Get to love somebo - dy Guess what It's gonna be me.. There comes a day when I'll be the one, you'll see.. It's gonna be me All that I do Is not enough for you Don't wanna lose it But I'm not like that When finally (finally) You get to love Guess what (guess what) Every little thing I do Never seems enough for you You don't wanna lose it again But I'm not like them Baby, when you fina - lly Get to love somebo - dy Guess what It's gonna be me Every little thing I do Never seems enough for you You don't wanna lose it again But I'm not like them Baby, when you fina - lly Get to love somebo - dy Guess what It's gonna be me.."
