I'm more than grateful for the time we spent , my spirit's at ease I put my heart into your hands Learn the lessons you teach No matter when, wherever I am You're not hard to reach And you've given me the best gift That I've ever known You give me pur pose everyday You give me pur pose , in every way Oh , you are my every thing Oh , you are my every thing"
