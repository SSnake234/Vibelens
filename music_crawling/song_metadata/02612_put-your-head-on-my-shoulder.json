Just a kiss goodnight, may be You and I will fall in love (you and I will fall in love) People say that love's a game A game you just can't win If there's a way I'll find it some day And then this fool will rush in Put your head on my shoulder Whisper in my ear, ba by Words I want to hear tell me, tell me that you love me too (tell me that you love me too) Put your head on my shoul der Whisper in my ear, ba by Words I want to hear, ba by Put your head on my shoulder..."
