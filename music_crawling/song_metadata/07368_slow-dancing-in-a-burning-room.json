  "lyrics": " - - - - - - Intro:   It's not a silly little moment It's not the storm before the calm This is the deep and dying breath of This love that we've been working on Can't seem to hold you like I want to So I can feel you in my arms Nobody's gonna come and save you We've pulled too many false alarms And you can see it too And you know that we're doomed My Dear we're slow dancing in a burning room    I was the one you always dreamed of You were the one I tried to draw How dare you say it's nothing to me Baby you're the only light I ever saw I'll make the most of all the sadness You'll be a bitch because you can You try to hit me just to hurt me so you leave me feeling dirty Because you can't understand       Go Cry about it why don't you ( repeat 3 times) My Dear we're slow dancing in a burning room     Don't you think we outta know by now Don't you think we should've learned somehow Don't you think we outta know by now Don't you think we should've learned somehow Don't you think we outta know by now Don't you think we should've learned somehow"
