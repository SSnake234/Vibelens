Water pouring down from the ceilin' I knew this would happen, still hard to believe it Maybe I'm dramatic, I don't wanna seem it I don't wanna panic I'm a sad girl, in this big world It's a mad world All of my friends know what's happened You're a bad thing (ah!) I know I fucked up, I'm just a loser Shouldn't be with ya, guess I'm a quitter While you're out there drinkin', I'm just here thinkin' I've been lonely, mm, ah, yeah. La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la Lonely (I'm a lonely bitch) La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la Lonely (super lonely) Now I'm in the bathtub, cryin' Think I'm slowly sinking, bubbles in my eyes Now, maybe I'm just dreamin' Now I'm in the sad club, just tryna get a backrub (lonely) I'm a sad girl, in this big world It's a mad world All of my friends know what's happened You're a bad thing (ah!) I know I fucked up, I'm just a loser Shouldn't be with ya, guess I'm a quitter While you're out there drinkin', I'm just here thinkin' I've been lonely, mm, ah, yeah. La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la Lonely (I'm a lonely bitch) La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la Lonely (super lonely) I loathe romancing in itself yea I'd be damned to try I'm only dancing by myself so I don't slam my Irish buck Compostable cups B-B-Benee I can't stress this enough I would hate to mess things up But my boogie still stays restless as fuck, yeah I know I fucked up, I'm just a loser Shouldn't be with ya, guess I'm a quitter While you're out there drinkin', I'm just here thinkin' I've been lonely, mm, ah, yeah. La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la Lonely (I'm a lonely bitch) La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la Lonely (super lonely)"
