  "lyrics": "I was made the wrong way Won't you do me the right way? Where you gonna be tonight 'Cause I won't stay too long? Maybe you're the light for me When you talk to me it s trikes me Won't somebody help me 'Cause I don't feel too strong? Was it something that I said, was it something that I did Or the combination of both that did me on You know I'm hoping you'll sing along Even if it's not your favorite song Don't wanna be there when There's nothing left to say You know that some of us spin again And when you do you need a friend Don't wanna be there when There's nothing left for me And I hate the thought of finally being erased But baby that's the best of me  Everything's behind you But the hopeless signs besides you I'm living in the moment Have I wasted all your time? Was it something that I said, was it something that I did Or the combination of both that did me on You know I'm hoping you'll sing along Even if it's not your favorite song Don't wanna be there when There's nothing left to say You know that some of us spin again And when you do you need a friend Don't wanna be there when There's nothing left for me And I hate the thought finally being erased But baby that's the best of me, yeah Baby that's the best of me You know I'm hoping you'll sing along Even if it's not your favorite song Don't wanna be there when There's nothing left to say You know that some of us spin again And when you do you need a friend Don't wanna be there when There's nothing left for me And I hate the thought of finally being erased But baby that's the best of me"
