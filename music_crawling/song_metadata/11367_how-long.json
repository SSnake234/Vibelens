You've been acting so shady I've been feeling it lately, baby Oooo Oooo Oooo Oooo I'll admit, it's my fault But you gotta believe me When I say it only happened once I tried and I tried, but you'll never see that You're the only one I wanna love, ooh, yeah She said \"Boy, tell me honestly Was it real or just for show?\" Yeah She said \"Save your apologies Baby, I just gotta know\" You've been creeping 'round on me While you're calling me baby How long has this been going on?
