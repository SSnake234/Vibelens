  "lyrics": "- - - - x2 Love that once hung on the wall Used to mean something But now it means nothing The echoes are gone in the hall But I still remember The pain of December Oh there isn't one thing left to say I'm sorry it's too late I'm breaking free from these memories Gotta let it go just let it go I've said goodbye Set it all on fire Gotta let it go just let it  go You came back to find that I was gone And that place is empty Like the hole that Like we were nothing at all It's not what you meant to me Thought we were meant to be Oh there isn't one thing left to say too late I'm breaking free from these memories Gotta let it go just let it go I've said goodbye Set it all on fire Gotta let it go just let it go - - - - And let it go And now I know A brand new life Is down this road And when it's right You always know So this time There's only one thing left here to say Love's never too late I've broken free from those memories I've let it go I've let it go And two goodbyes Led to this new life Don't let me go don't let me go  ohhhh ohhh ohhhh Don't let me go Don't let me go (hold)  - - - - x4 Won't let you go Don't let me go Won't let you go Don't let me go Won't let you go Don't let me go Won't let you go Don't let me go"
