  "lyrics": "Watching every motion in my foolish lover's game On this endless ocean finally lover's know no shame Turning and returning to some secret place inside Watching in slow motion as you turn around and say Take my breath away  Take my breath away  Watching I keep waiting still anticipating love Never hesitating to become the fated ones Turning and returning to some secret place to hide Watching in slow motion as you turn around and say, My love Take my breath away  Take my breath away  Through the hourglass I saw you In time you slept away When the mirror crashed I call you And turned to hear you say Only for today I'm unafraid Take my breath away  Take my breath away  Lên tông 1 + ½ Watching I keep waiting still anticipating love Never hesitating to become the fated ones Turning and returning to some secret place to hide Watching in slow motion as you turn around and say, My love Take my breath away  Take my breath away "
