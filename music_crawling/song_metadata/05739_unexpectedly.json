  "lyrics": "Intro:  I have always been a man with a plan Always prepared never once leave it to chance But it's all unscripted when I'm with you It seems familiar yet it all feels so new All of the sudden I miss you thinking bout All of the things that we've been through Oh no it's not that I planned to But I think it feels like Maybe I'm falling for you and me Were we ever meant to be? Suddenly oh you caught me so off guard We fell in love so unexpectedly So unexpectedly I've known it for five years and a day Never once thought I'd have these words to say I wanna hold you and kiss you Till the end of time And when you're out of sight oh... All of the sudden I miss you thinking bout All of the things that we've been through Oh no it's not that I planned to But I think it feels like Maybe I'm falling for you and me I just don't know oh Were we ever meant to be? Suddenly oh you caught me so off guard We fell in love so unexpectedly So unexpectedly The one I'm searching for was right here all along Now I see I see you standing right in front of me The one I'm searching for was right here all along How did we we fall in love so unexpectedly I just don't know oh were we ever meant to be? Suddenly oh you caught me so off guard We fell in love so unexpectedly So unexpectedly We fell in love so unexpectedly"
