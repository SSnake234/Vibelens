  "lyrics": "It’s a- mazing how you can speak right to my heart  Without say ing A word , you can light up the dark  Try as I may I could never explain What I hear when you don't say a thing The smile on your face lets me know that you need me There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me A touch of your hand says you'll catch me whenever I fall Now, you say it best when you say nothing at all  x 2 All day long I can hear people talking out loud  But when you hold me near you drown out the crowd  Try as I may they could never define What's being said between your heart and mine The smile on your face lets me know that you need me There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me A touch of your hand says you'll catch me whenever I fall Now, you say it best when you say nothing at all Solo:  x 3 - The smile on your face lets me know that you need me There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me A touch of your hand says you'll catch me whenever I fall Now, you say it best when you say nothing at all Now, you say it best when you say nothing at all Now, you say it best when you say nothing at all"
