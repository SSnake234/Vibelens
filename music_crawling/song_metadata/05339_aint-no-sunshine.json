Ain't no sunshine when she's gone, and she's always gone too long, Anytime she goes away  Wonder this time where she's gone  Wonder if she's gone to stay  Ain't no sunshine when she's gone, and this house just ain't no home, Anytime she goes away  But ain't no sunshine when she's gone  But ain't no sunshine when she's gone  only darkness everyday.  Ain't no sunshine when she's gone, and this house just ain't no home Anytime she goes away.  Anytime she goes away.  Anytime she goes away.  Anytime she goes away.  Anytime she goes aw y.  "
