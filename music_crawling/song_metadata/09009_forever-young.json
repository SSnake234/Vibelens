  "lyrics": "Let's dance in style, lets dance for a while Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies Hoping for the best but expecting the worst Are you going to drop the bomb or not? Let us die young or let us live forever We don't have the power but we never say never Sitting in a sandpit , life is a short trip The music's for the sad men Forever young, I want to be forever young do you really want to live forever, forever forever Forever young, I want to be forever young do you really want to live forever, forever forever Some are like water , some are like the heat Some are a melody and some are the beat Sooner or later they all will be gone why don't they stay young It's so hard to get old without a cause I don't want to perish like a fleeing horse Youth's like diamonds in the sun and diamonds are forever Forever young, I want to be forever young do you really want to live forever, forever forever Forever young, I want to be forever young do you really want to live forever, forever forever So many adventures couldn't happen today So many songs we forgot to play So many dreams swinging out of the blue We let them come true Forever young, I want to be forever young do you really want to live forever, forever forever Forever young, I want to be forever young do you really want to live forever, forever forever"
