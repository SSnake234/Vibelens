So baby pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover That I know you can't afford Bite that tattoo on your shoulder Pull the sheets right off the corner Of the mattress that you stole From your roommate back in Boulder We ain't ever getting older.  ... ..We ain't ever getting older  ... ..We ain't ever getting older. 2. You, look as the good as the day as I met you I forget just why I left you, I was insane Stay, and play that Blink-182 song That we beat to death in Tuscon, okay."
