  "lyrics": "I've never seen you looking so lovely, as you did tonight. I've never seen you shine so bright... ooo... ooo I've never seen so many men asking if you wanted to dance. They're looking for a little romance, given half a chance. And I have never seen that dress you're wearing. Or the highlights in your hair that catch your eyes. I have been blind. The lady in red, is dancing with me.... Cheek to cheek. There's nobody here, it's just you and me. It's where I want to be. But I hardly know this beauty by my  side. I'll never forget.... The way you look tonight. The lady in Red, my lady in red, my lady in red, my lady in R R ed."
