  "lyrics": "Everything you do it sends me Higher than the moon with every Twinkle in your eye You strike a match that lights my heart on fire When you're near, I hide my blushing face Grace just isn't my forté But it brings me to my knees when you say Hello, how are you , my darling , today ? I fall into a pile on the floor Puppy love is hard to ig nore When every little thing you do, I do a dore We're as different as can be I've noticed you're remarkably re laxed We balance out each other nicely You wear sandals in the snow In mid-July I still feel cold We're opposites in every way But I can't resist it when you say Hello, how are you , my darling , today ? I fall into a pile on the floor Puppy love is hard to ig nore When every little thing you do, I do a dore Finding words, I mutter Tongue-tied, twisted Foot in mouth, I start to stutter Ha, ha, hea ven help me Hello, how are you , my darling , today ? I fall into a pile on the floor Puppy love is hard to ig nore When every little thing you do, I do a dore Every little thing ba ba ba ba Every little thing ba ba ba ba Every little thing you do, I do a dore"
