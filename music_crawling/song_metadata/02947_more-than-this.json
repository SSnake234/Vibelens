  "lyrics": "   I'm broken Do you hear me I'm blinded Cause you are everything I see I'm dancing, alone I'm praying That your heart will just turn around And as I walk up to your door My eyes turn to face the floor Cause I can't look you in the eyes and say When he opens his arms And holds you close tonight Cause I can love you more than this, yeah When he lays you down, I might just die inside Cause I can love you more than this Love you more than this If I'm louder Would you see me? Would you lay down in my arms and rescue me? Cause we are, the same You saved me, but when you leave it's gone again And then I see you on the street In his arms, I get weak My body fails I'm on my knees When he opens his arms And holds you close tonight Cause I can love you more than this, yeah When he lays you down, I might just die inside Cause I can love you more than this I've never had the words to say But now I'm asking you to stay For a little while inside my arms And as you close your eyes tonight I pray that you will see the light That's shining from the stars above When he opens his arms And holds you close tonight Cause I can love you more than this When he lays you down, I might just die inside Cause I can love you more than this, yeah When he opens his arms And holds you close tonight Cause I can love you more than this, yeah When he lays you down, I might just die inside Cause I can love you more than this Love you more than this"
