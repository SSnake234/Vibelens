Tryna keep my mind at bay sun flower still grows at night Waitin' for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes Make it down down, d-d- down Diggy dig down, du du du du Waitin' for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes And so s he sat me down and told me that I didn't have to cry Said I didn't need to get down or feel empty inside And then told me that she'll love me for as long as she's alive And well, maybe she's right, ' cause I hate it when I feel like I'm not me See, I honestly, don't even know why I-I honestly don't even know why Tryna keep my mind at bay sun flower still grows at night Waitin' for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes Make it down down, d-d- down Diggy dig down, du du du du Waitin' for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes"
