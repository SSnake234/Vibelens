  "lyrics": "- - - Home grown alligator, see you later Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road The sun and change in the atmosphere, Architecture unfamiliar, I could get used to this Time flies by in the yellow and green, stick around and you’ll see what I mean. There’s a mountain top, that I’m dreaming of, If you need me, you know where I’ll be. I’ll be riding shotgun, Underneath the hot sun, Feeling like a someone. I’ll be riding shotgun, Underneath the hot sun, Feeling like a someone. The south of the equator, navigator, Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road. Deep-sea diving round the clock, Bikini bottoms, lager tops I could get used to this Time flies by in the yellow and green, stick around and you’ll see what I mean. There’s a mountain top, that I’m dreaming of, If you need me, you know where I’ll be. I’ll be riding shotgun, Underneath the hot sun, Feeling like a someone. I’ll be riding shotgun, Underneath the hot sun, Feeling like a someone. We got two in the front, two in the back, Sailing along and we don’t look back.  Time flies by in the yellow and green, stick around and you’ll see what I mean. There’s a mountain top, that I’m dreaming of, If you need me, you know where I’ll be. I’ll be riding shotgun, Underneath the hot sun, Feeling like a someone. I’ll be riding shotgun, Underneath the hot sun, Feeling like a someone."
