  "lyrics": "I've got my shit together I've got my sunny weather Inside my brain , when it is rain -ing out The window I'm opened like a flower I can go on for hours I think its better , better without you Leavin' my heart uncover Lift off by feet and hover Above the ground , all over town , Thats how im doin' I bet you miss me , do ya' ? But I hate to break it to ya' (Húuuuuu) But Im just better (uuuuu), better without you Cant even bother to complain 'bout the traffic on my lane Somebody's careless speedin' by I would hate to live this life I've traded out for mine Every single time I've got my shit together Takin' my time, no pressure No pain in my head , dont need no medical attention (at-ten-tionnn) Those shitty days are over As so im driving slower (sờ lầu ớooooo) Cause i just better , better without youuuu Better"
