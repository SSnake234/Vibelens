  "lyrics": "There are times I wish my heart was small So my longing for you disappears There are moments I wish time won't flow So your scent doesn't fade away Sing to free all worries you've had Say it loud and don't regret I love you~ hoo hoo~ I will tell you all that's been on my mind The sun fell into darkness Sank in sadness There's so much in my mind you don't get Is it the sunset pitch black Or it's my heart The hope all burned down to ash Simple melody will ease the pain Still the mind tries to hold onto you Piece of memories will always stay I am frozen since you're away Sing to free all worries you've had Say it loud and don't regret I love you~ hoo hoo~ I will tell you all that's been on my mind The sun fell into darkness Sank in sadness There's so much in my mind you don't get Is it the sunset pitch black Or it's my heart The hope all burned down to ash I keep all burning feelings in the heart shaped box So i watch you from afar One day you fall into some other warm safe arms I will wait for you inside your dream I will tell you all that's been on my mind..."
