Everytime I kiss I feel your lips And everytime I cry I see you smile And everytime I close my eyes ...I realise That everytime I hold your hand in mine The sweetest thing my heart could ever find And I have never felt this way ...Since the day I gave your love a way Save me I've fallen from my destiny You and I were meant to be I've thrown it all a way Now you're gone It's time for me to carry on But baby I just can't go on Without you by my side And all the things we ever wanted Were once yours and mine Now I know we can re vive it All the love we left... Everytime I kiss I feel your lips And everytime I cry I see you smile And everytime I close my eyes ...I realise That everytime I hold your hand in mine The sweetest thing my heart could ever find And I have never felt this way ...Since the day I gave your love a way We can survive it all the pain we feel in side You relied on me and now I've let you down Now I promise you fo rever I will be the best I can Now I know we can re vive it. All the love we left... Everytime I kiss I feel your lips And everytime I cry I see you smile And everytime I close my eyes ...I realise That everytime I hold your hand in mine The sweetest thing my heart could ever find And I have never felt this way Since the day I gave your love Everytime I kiss I feel your lips And everytime I cry I see you smile And everytime I close my eyes ...I realise That everytime I hold your hand in mine The sweetest thing my heart could ever find And I have never felt this way ...Since the day I gave your love a way"
