Holding on So much more than I can carry I keep dragging around what' s bringing me down If I just let go, I'd be set free Holding on Why is e verything so heavy? You say that I'm pa ra noid But I'm pretty sure the world is out to get me It's not like I make the choice To let my mind stay so fucking messy I know I'm not the center of the universe But you keep spin ning 'round me just the same I know I'm not the center of the universe But you keep spin ning 'round me just the same I'm holding on Why is e verything so heavy? Holding on So much more than I can carry I keep dragging around what' s bringing me down If I just let go, I'd be set free Holding on Why is e verything so heavy? I know I'm not the center of the universe But you keep spinning 'round me just the same I know I'm not the center of the universe But you keep spin ning 'round me just the same And I drive my self crazy Thinking everything's about me I keep dragging around what' s bringing me down If I just let go, I'd be set free Holding on Why is e verything so heavy?  Why is e verything so heavy?  Why is e verything so heavy?"
