  "lyrics": " I fell in love with you watching Casa blanca Back row of the drive in show in the flickering light Popcorn and cokes beneath the stars became champagne and caviar Making love on a long hot summers night. I thought you fell in love with me watching Casa blance Holding hands 'neath the paddle fans in Rick's Candle lit cafe Hiding in the shadows from the spies. Moroccan moonlight in your eyes Making magic at the movies in my old chevro let. Oh! A kiss is still a kiss in Casa blanca...... But a kiss is not a kiss without your sigh Please come back to me in Casa blanca I love you more and more each day as time goes by. I guess there're many broken hearts in Casa blanca You know I've never really been there. so, I don't know I guess our love story will never be seen on the big wide silver screen But it hurt just as bad when I had to watch you go. Oh! A kiss is still a kiss in Casa blanca But a kiss is not a kiss without your sigh Please come back to me in Casa blanca I love you more and more each day as time goes by. Oh! A kiss is still a kiss in Casa blanca But a kiss is not a kiss without your sigh Please come back to me in Casa blanca I love you more and more each day as time goes by I love you more and more each day as time goes by."
