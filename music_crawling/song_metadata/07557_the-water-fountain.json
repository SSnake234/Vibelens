  "lyrics": "tone She told me that she loved me by the water fountain She told me that she loved me and she didn't love him And that was really lovely cause it was innocent But now she's got a cup with something else in it It's getting kind of blurry at a quarter past ten And he was in a hurry to be touching her skin She's feeling kind of dirty when she's dancing with him Forgetting what she told me by the water fountain Now he's grabbing her hips and pulling her in Kissing her lips and whispering in her Ear and she knows that she shouldn't listen And that she should be with me by the water fountain She couldn't be at home in the nighttime because It made her feel alone but at that time she was Too young I was too young I should have built a home with a fountain for us The moment that she told me that she was in love Too young I was too young Too young Too young Too young Young And if she ever goes back to the water fountain The handle will be broken and the rust set in But my hand it will be open and I'll try to fix it My heart it will be open and I'll try to give it Now I'm grabbing her hips and pulling her in Kissing her lips and whispering in her Ear and I know that it's only a wish And that we're not standing by the water fountain Too young Too young Too young Young She couldn't be at home in the nighttime because It made her feel alone but at that time she was Too young I was too young I should have built a home with a fountain for us The moment that she told me that she was in love Too young I was too young Too young Too young Too young Young I should have built a home with a fountain for us The moment that she told me that she was in love Too young I was too young"
