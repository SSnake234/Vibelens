I am the foolish Gatsby who's found drown in love Can't you see my heart bur ning right through my hands? Cos your smile lifts me a bove and beyond the blue sky In the darkest moments here I still can see your eyes Love you to the moon and back. I can't let you know this fact Love you to the moon and back. I'm so freaking missing you Aim for the moon yet so far. I can't land among the stars Love you to the moon and back. I'm so freaking missing you I'll never let my love get so close to you cos it hurts Swear to God! I wish I could I am the foolish Gatsby who's found drown in love Can't you see my heart bur ning right through my hands? Cos your smile lifts me a bove and beyond the blue sky In the darkest moments here I still can see your eyes Love you to the moon and back. I can't let you know this fact Love you to the moon and back. I'm so freaking missing you Aim for the moon yet so far. I can't land among the stars Love you to the moon and back. I'm so freaking missing you Love you to the moon and back. I can't let you know this fact Love you to the moon and back. I'm so freaking missing you Aim for the moon yet so far. I can't land among the stars Love you to the moon and back. I'm so freaking missing you"
