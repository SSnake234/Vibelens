Decisions as I go, to anywhere I flow. Sometimes I believe, a time where we should know. I can fly high, I can go long. Today I got a million, tomorrow, I don't know.  Stop crying like you're home and think about the show. We're all playing the same game, I'm laying down along. We're unknown and wrong, special when I come. Hate will make you cautious, love will make you glow. Make me feel the warm, make me feel the cold. It's written in our story, it's written on the walls. This is our call, we rise and we fall. Dancin' in the moonlight, don't we have it all?  Decisions as I go, to anywhere I flow. Sometimes I believe, a time where we should know. I can fly high, I can go long. Today I got a million, tomorrow, I don't know. Make me feel the warm, make me feel the cold. It's written in our story, it's written on the walls. This is our call, we rise and we fall. Dancin' in the moonlight, don't we have it all?  "
