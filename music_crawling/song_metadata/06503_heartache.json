Yeah I wish that I could do it again  ohh Turnin’ back the time back when you were mine (all mine) So this is heartache? So this is heartache? Hiroi atsumeta kōkai wa namida e to kawari oh baby So this is heartache? So this is heartache? Ano hi no kimi no egao wa omoide ni kawaru I miss you  Boku no kokoro o yuiitsu mitashite satte yuku kimi ga Boku no kokoro ni yuiitsu fure rareru koto ga dekita kimi wa  Oh baby Mō inai yo mō nani mo nai yo Yeah I wish that I could do it again Turnin’ back the time back when you were mine (all mine) So this is heartache? So this is heartache? Hiroi atsumeta kōkai wa namida e to kawari oh baby So this is heartache? So this is heartache? Ano hi no kimi no egao wa omoide ni kawaru I miss you Bridge F It’s so hard to forget Kataku musunda sono musubime wa It’s so hard to forget Tsuyoku hikeba hiku hodo ni You and all the regret Hodokenaku natte hanare renaku natta Ima wa tsurai yo sore ga tsurai yo sugu wasuretai yo kimi o So this is heartache? So this is heartache? Hiroi atsumeta kōkai wa namida e to kawari oh baby So this is heartache? So this is heartache? Ano hi no kimi no egao wa omoide ni kawaru I miss you  "
