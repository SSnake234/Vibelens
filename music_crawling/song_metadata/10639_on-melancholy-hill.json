  "lyrics": "Up on melancholy hill There's a plastic tree Are you here with me? Just looking out on the day Of another dream Well you can't get what you want But you can get me So let's head out to sea 'Cause you are my medicine When you're close to me When you're close to me So call in the submarine 'Round the world we'll go Does anybody know? If we're looking out on the day Of another dream If you can't get what you want Then you come with me Up on melancholy hill Sits a manatee Just looking out on the day When you're close to me When you're close to me When you're close to me"
