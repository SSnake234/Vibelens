  "lyrics": "No one knows what it's like, to be the bad man, To be the sad man, behind blue eyes No one knows what it's like to be hated, To be fated, to telling only lies But my dreams , they aren't as empty, As my conscience seems to be I have hours, only lonely My love is vengeance that's never free No one knows what it's like to feel these feelings Like I do, and I blame you No one bites back as hard on their anger None of my pain and woe, can show through But my dreams , they aren't as empty, As my conscience seems to be I have hours, only lonely My love is vengeance that's never free No one knows what its like To be mistreated, to be defeated Behind blue eyes No one knows how to say That they're sorry and don't worry I'm not telling lies But my dreams , they aren't as empty, As my conscience seems to be I have hours, only lonely My love is vengeance that's never free No one knows what it's like, to be the bad man, To be the sad man, behind blue eyes"
