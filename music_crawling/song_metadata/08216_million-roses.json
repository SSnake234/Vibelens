  "lyrics": "There lived an artist alone who sold his paintings and home And left his palettes behind for this one purpose alone This famous actress he loved only red flowers preferred So for his money he bought one million roses for her. Anywhere, anywhere, anywhere, she could turn Everything in the square down below blooming red Those in love, those in love, those in love, she would learn Gladly leave things behind for a glance instead. Early next day she did rise hardly believing her eyes One million roses below under the blue morning skies She thought that gift must have come from some unknown tycoon Leaving the artist alone standing there all after- noon. Anywhere, anywhere, anywhere, she could turn Everything in the square down below blooming red Those in love, those in love, those in love, she would learn Gladly leave things behind for a glance instead. Only a minute she spared for his enormous bouquet After a late show that night she left for good on a train There stayed the artist alone, poor and completely forlorn But he would never regret the city with roses adorned. Anywhere, anywhere, anywhere, she could turn Everything in the square down below blooming red Those in love, those in love, those in love, she would learn Gladly leave things behind for a glance instead."
