  "lyrics": "It's just another night, and I'm stari ng at the Moon, I saw a shooting star and thought of you. I sang a lullaby by the wat erside and knew, If you were here I'd sing to you. You're on the other side as the skyline splits in two, Miles away from seeing you. But I can see the stars from Amer - i - ca I wonder do you see them too. So open your eyes and see, The way our horizons meet. And all of the lights will leave, Into the night with me. And I know these scars will bleed, But both of our hearts believe, All of these stars will guid us home. I can hear your heart on the ra - di - o beats, They're playing 'Chasing Cars' and I thought of us. Back to the time you were lying next to me, I looked across and fell in love. So I took your hand back through lamp lit streets and dew, Everything led back to you. So can you see the stars over Am - ster - dam? Hear the song my heart is beating to. So open your eyes and see, The way our horizons meet. And all of the lights will leave, Into the night with me. And I know these scars will bleed, But both of our hearts believe, All of these stars will guid us home. And all you know , And all I can see the stars from Amer - i - ca"
