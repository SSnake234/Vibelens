  "lyrics": "  - Oceans a-part day after day And I slowly go in -sane I hear your voice on the line But it doesn't stop the pain If I see you next to never How can we say forever Where ever you go What ever you do I will be right here waiting for you Whatever it takes Or how my heart breaks I will be right here waiting for you I took for granted, all the times That I though would last some -how I hear the laughter, I taste the tears But I can't get near you now Oh, can you see it baby You've got me goin' crazy Where ever you go What ever you do I will be right here waiting for you Whatever it takes Or how my heart breaks I will be right here waiting for you I wonder how we can sur -vive, this romance But in the end if I'm with you I'll take the chance  Oh, can you see it baby You've got me goin' crazy Where ever you go What ever you do I will be right here waiting for you Whatever it takes Or how my heart breaks I will be right here waiting for you"
