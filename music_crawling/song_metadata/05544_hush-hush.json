  "lyrics": "I never needed you to be strong I never needed you for pointin' out my wrongs i never needed pain, i never needed strenght My love for you was strong enough you should've known. I never needed you for judgement I never needed you to question what i spent I never ask for help, I take care of myself I don't know why you think you got a hold on me. And it's a little late for conversations There isn't anything that you can do. And my eyes hurt, hands shiver, so look at me, listen to me because I don't want to Stay another minute I don't want you To say a single word Hush Hush, Hush Hush There is no other way I get the final say I don't want to Do this any longer I don't want you There's nothing left to say Hush Hush, Hush Hush I've already spoken Our love is broken Baby Hush Hush I never needed your corrections On everything from how i act to what i say i never needed words, i never needed hurt, i never needed you to be there everyday I'm sorry for the way i let go Of everything i wanted when you came along But i am never beaten, broken, not defeated I know next to you is not where i belong And it's a little late for explanations There isn't anything that you can do And my eyes hurt, hands shiver, so you will listen when i say baby I don't want to Stay another minute I don't want you To say a single word Hush Hush, Hush Hush There is no other way I don't want to Do this any longer I don't want you There's nothing left to say Hush Hush, Hush Hush I've already spoken Baby Hush Hush No more words No more lies No more crying ooh ooh No more pain No more hurt No more tryin' Oh Oh Yeah I don't want to Stay another minute I don't want you To say a single word Hush Hush, Hush Hush There is no other way I don't want to Do this any longer I don't want you There's nothing left to say Hush Hush, Hush Hush I've already spoken Baby Hush Hush' Yeah Oh Hush Hush, Hush Hush I've already spoken"
