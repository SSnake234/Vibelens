  "lyrics": "You say you'll be down in 5 The smell of your perfume is floating down the stairs You're fixing up your hair like you do I know that I'll be a mess The second that I see you It happens every time It's always on a night like tonight I think that you can read my mind Cause when you look at me with those eyes I'm speechless Staring at you, standing there in that dress What it's doing to me, ain't a secret Cause watching you is all that I can do And I'm speechless You already know that you're my weakness After all this time I'm just as nervous Every time you walk into the room I'm  speechless It started when you said hello Just did something to me And I've been in a daze Ever since the day that we meet You take the breath out of my lungs And all of the words out of my mouth without even trying Oh, you know it, baby"
