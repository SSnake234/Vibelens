  "lyrics": "He was only nineteen and was sentenced to die for something that somebody else did, and blamed on El lute Then they changed it to life, and so he could escape From then on they chased him, and searched for him day and night all over Spain But the search was in vain for El Lute He had only seen the dark side of life, the man they called El Lute And he wanted a home just like you and like me in a country where all would be free So he taught himself to read and to write, it didn't help El Lute He was one who had dared to escape overnight They had to find El Lute Soon the fame of his name, spread like wild fire all over the land with a price on his head people still gave him bread and they gave him a hand For they knew he was right, and his fight was their fight No one gave you a chance in the Spain of those days On the walls every place they had put up the face of El Lute And he robbed where he could just like once Robin Hood They finally caught him and that seemed the end but they caught him in vain ‘cause a change came for Spain and El Lute He had only seen the dark side of life, the man they called El Lute And he wanted a home just like you and like me in a country where all would be free And then freedom really came to his land and also to El Lute Now he walks in the light of a sunny new day, he man they called El Lute"
