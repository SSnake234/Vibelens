This bitch behind me is cutting my hair \"No, just sit your ass down at the chalkboard and stare\" I faked up a seizure and left outta there Yeah, I'm coughing I’m bleeding, Band-Aids won't heal it 'Cause they hate me, so I'm fakin' All, of this so they take, take me Take me home Give me that pink slip of permission This is old I'm tired of wishing I was ditching Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh- ooh Take me home Give me that pink slip of permission This is old I'm tired of wishing I was ditching Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh- ooh"
