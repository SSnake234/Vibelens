  "lyrics": "Spend all y our time wait ing for that second c hance For the br eak that wou ld make it o kay. There's always some reason to f eel not good enough And it's ha rd at the end of the day I need some distrac tion, a beaut iful release M emories se ep from my veins Let me be empty, oh and weightless, and maybe I'll find some pe ace to night In the a rms of the a ngel, fly away from here F rom this dark, cold hotel room, and the endlessness that you fear You are pulled from the wreckage of your silent reverie You're in the arms of the angel, may you find s ome comfort here. So tired of this straight line, and everywhere you turn There's vultures and theives at your back The storm keeps on twisting, you keep o n building the lies That you make up for all that you lack. It don't make no diffe rence, escaping one last time It's easier to be lieve In this sweet madness, oh this glorious sadness That brings me to my kne es."
