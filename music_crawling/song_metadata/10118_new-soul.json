  "lyrics": "I'm a new soul, I came to this strange world Hoping I could learn a bit about how to give and take But since I came here, felt the joy and the fear Finding myself making every possible mistake Hoping I could learn a bit about what is true and fake But why all these hate? try to communicate Finding trust and love is not always easy to make 'Cause you don't understand Everything you have done Why's everything so wrong This is a happy end Come and give me your hand I'll take you far away"
