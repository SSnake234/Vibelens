Thought we had the time, had our lives, Now you'll never get older, older Didn't say goodbye, now I'm f rozen in time, Getting colder, colder One last word, One last moment, to ask you w hy you left me here behind    We had plans We had visions Now I can't see ahead We were one We were golden For ever you said   "
