  "lyrics": "If I could save (Dm(maj7))time in a bottle The first thing that I'd like to do Is to save every day till eternity passes away Just to spend them with you. If I could make (Dm(maj7))days last forever If words could make wishes come true I'd save every day like a treasure and then Again, I would spend them with you. But there ever seems to be enough time To do the things you want to do Once you find them  I've looked around enough to know That you're the one I want to go through time with.  If I had a (Dm(maj7))box just for wishes And dreams that had never come true The box would be empty except for the memory Of how they were answered by you But there ever seems to be enough time To do the things you want to do Once you find them  I've looked around enough to know That you're the one I want to go through time with.
