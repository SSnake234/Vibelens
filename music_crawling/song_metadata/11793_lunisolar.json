  "lyrics": "Just the sun hits on my hair, like shiny hope But don't know where to go and I don't know what to do Damn ridiculous city, sling off at me It makes me deep and mad and sad You wake me up, when meet you in the club Cause your soft and warm and cozy voice That time, I think you're getting into me Just like a falling star (like a falling star) Take you up to the sky you don't need to be afraid Hold my hand, close your eyes you can see the galaxy Take you up to the sky you don't need to be afraid Stars will hug you hard and makes us into fair galaxy     Stars will hug you hard and makes us into fair galaxy     Stars will hug you hard and makes us into fair galaxy Just the moon hits on my face, like cooling dream But don't know where to go and I don't know what to do Damn ridiculous city, sling off at me It makes me sick and tough and hurt You wake me up, when see you on the floor Cause your light and fascinating move That time, I think you're getting into me Just like a shooting star, like a shooting star Take you up to the sky you don't need to be afraid Hold my hand, close your eyes you can see the galaxy Take you up to the sky you don't need to be afraid Stars will hug you hard and makes us into fair galaxy    Take you up to the sky you don't need to be afraid Stars will hug you hard and makes us into fair galaxy     Stars will hug you hard and makes us into fair galaxy     Stars will hug you hard and makes us into fair galaxy When night comes, hug each other, remember our history Breath of love, touch your body, we complete like diamond Take you high, feel up high, we just go in for the love Stars will hug you hard and makes us into fair galaxy"
