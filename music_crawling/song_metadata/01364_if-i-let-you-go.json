(ohhh yeah) How will I know? If I let you go... Night after night I hear myself say why don´t this feeling just fade away there´s no one like you you speak to my heart It´s such a shame we´re worlds apart I´m too shy to ask I´m too proud to lo ose But sooner or later I gotta choose and once a gain I´m thinking a bout Taking the ease way out But If I let you go I will never know What my life would be holding you close to me Will I e ver see you smiling back at me? (ohhh yeah) How will I know? If I let you go... If I let you go...u hhh baby... and once a gain I´m thinking a bout Taking the ease way out But If I let you go I will never know What my life would be holding you close to me Will I e ver see you smiling back at me? (ohhh yeah) How will I know? If I let you go... But If I let you go I will never know What my life would be holding you close to me Will I e ver see you smiling back at me? (ohhh yeah) How will I know? If I let you go..."
