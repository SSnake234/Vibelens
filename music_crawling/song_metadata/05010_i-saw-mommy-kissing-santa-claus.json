  "lyrics": "I saw mommy kissing Santa Claus Underneath the misletoe last night. She didn't see me creep Down the stairs to have a peep; She thought that I was tucked up In my bedroom fast asleep. Then I saw mommy tickle Santa Claus Underneath his beard so snowy white; Oh, what a laugh it would have been If Daddy had only seen Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night."
