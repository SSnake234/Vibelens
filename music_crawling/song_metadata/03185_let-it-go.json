  "lyrics": "  x2 ...From walkin' home and talkin' loads ...Seein' chirps in evenin' clothes with you ...From nervous touch and gettin' drunk ...To stayin' up and wakin' up with you And now we're slippin' at the edge Holdin' somethin' we don't need Oh, this delusion in our heads Is gonna bring us to our knees So come on let it gooooooooo Just let it beeeeeeeeee Why don't you be youuuuuuuu And I'll be me Everything's that's broooooke Leave it to the breeeeeeeeze Why don't you be youuuuuuuu And I'll be me  x2 ...From throwin' clothes across the floor ...To teeth and clothes and slammin' doors at you ...If this is all we're livin' for Why are we doin' it, doin' it, doin' it anymore I used to recognize myself It's funny how reflections change And we're becomin' somethin' else I think it's time to walk away So come on let it gooooooooo Just let it beeeeeeeeee Why don't you be youuuuuuuu And I'll be me Everything's that's broooooke Leave it to the breeeeeeeeze Why don't you be youuuuuuuu And I'll be me   Tryin' to fit your hand inside of mine There's no force on earth Could make me feel right, no Tryin' to push this problem up the hill Think now's the time to let it slide So come on let it gooooooooo Just let it beeeeeeeeee Why don't you be youuuuuuuu And I'll be me Everything's that's broooooooke Leave it to the breeeeeeeeeeeze Let the ashes faaaaaaaaalllll Forget about me So come on let it gooooooooo Just let it beeeeeeeeee Why don't you be youuuuuuuu And I'll be me And I'll be me  x2"
