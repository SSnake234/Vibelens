  "lyrics": " Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain. telling me just what a fool I've been. I whish that it would go and let me cry in vain. and let me be al one ag ain. The only girl I care about is gone away. looking for a brand new start . little did she know that when she left that day.along with her she took my heart. Rain, please tell me now does that seem fair. for her to steal my heart away when she don't care. I can't love another while my heart's. somewhere fa r away. Rain won't you tell her that I love her so. please, ask the Sun to set her heart aglow. Rain in her heart and let the love. we knew start to grow."
