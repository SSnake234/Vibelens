  "lyrics": "  ... You had me hooked again from the minute you sat down The way you bite your lip got my head spinnin' around After a drink or two I was putty in your hands I don't know if I have the strength to stand (Oh oh oh...) Trouble troublemaker, yeah, that's your middle name, I know you're no good but you're stuck in my brain And I wanna know Why does it feel so good but hurt so bad My mind keeps saying run as fast as you can I say I'm done but then you pull me back I swear you're giving me a heart attack, troublemaker It's like you're always there in the corners of my mind I see a silhouette every time I close my eyes There must be poison in those finger tips of yours Cause I keep comin' back again for more Trouble troublemaker, yeah, that's your middle name I know you're no good but you're stuck in my brain, and I wanna know Why does it feel so good but hurt so bad My mind keeps saying run as fast as you can I say I'm done but then you pull me back I swear you're giving me a heart attack, troublemaker Maybe I'm insane 'cause I keep doing the same damn thing Thinking one day we gon' change, but you know just how to work that back And make me forget my name what the hell you do I won't remember I'll be gone until November and you'll show up again next summer, yeah! Typical middle name is Prada Fit you like a glove girl I'm sick of the drama You're a troublemaker but damn girl it's like I love the trouble And I can't even explain why"
