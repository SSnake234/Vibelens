Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out? Just wait, can you call me please? 'Cause I wanna be with you WOOOOO....... WOOOOOOO Can we talk for a moment? Got these feelings that I'm tired of holding on Wasn't tryna get wasted I needed more than three or four to say this Oh, let me apologize I'll make up, make up, make up, make up for all those times Your love, I don't wanna lose I'm beggin', beggin', beginn', beggin', I'm begging you Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around? Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out? Just wait, can you call me please? 'Cause I wanna be with you WOOOOO....... WOOOOOOO Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around? Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out? Just wait, can you call me please? 'Cause I wanna be with you WOOOOO....... WOOOOOOO  You say I'm just another bad guy You say I've done a lot of things I can't undo Before you tell me for the last time I'm beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin' you Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around? Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out? Just wait, can you call me please? 'Cause I wanna be with you WOOOOO....... WOOOOOOO Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around? Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out? Just wait, can you call me please? 'Cause I wanna be with you WOOOOO....... WOOOOOOO"
