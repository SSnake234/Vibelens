Tone Intro:   Dreaming of you when I'm alone Baby don't trip I'm coming home, kick it with me I don't care if the sun is gone Baby don't cry when I am gone, promise you are everything I want This is for you baby listen it's your song Oye carino, solo pienso en ti When I wake up in the morning until I go back to sleep How I wish you were mine, I think of you all the time I always feel like I'm flying, baby you make me feel fine Lost in the words that you say to me y pasando tiempo juntos is the ultimate dream I'm on the top of the world baby girl can't you see I found my perfect girl, I want to make you my queen Time and time again I can be feeling real sad, cos mi sueno no se ha hecho una realidad Pero el tiempo dira¡, el tiempo dira¡ If we go spend our life together en lo que el mundo gira I promise I don't want nobody else to be around me but you and nobody's touch Our hands in a lock, nuestros labios se conocen Nuestra noche es corta pero hermosa we'll be okay Dreaming of you when i'm alone Baby don't trip i'm coming home, kick it with me i don't care if the sun is down Baby don't cry when I am gone, promise you are everything i want This is for you baby listen, it's your song Sin ti mis dias son largos y se sienten tan amargos Me ahogo en un lago de mis lagrimas que hago Can't look forward to my future if it ain't including you Promise that I'm gonna love you, it's about that time you do I swear I don't see nothing but I want to lay here with you And I hope you know I miss you, from my head, I can't dismiss you Eres lo que yo anhelaba en esta vida, que me falta Lo que siento is surreal, i can't lie to you for real Sabes bien que te quiero and if you're down to spend your summer with me just let me know You know you are my sueno, you came to my life and now I feel alright Dreaming of you when I'm alone Baby don't trip I'm coming home, kick it with me I don't care if the sun is down Baby don't cry when I am gone, promise you are everything I want This is for you baby listen, it's your song"
