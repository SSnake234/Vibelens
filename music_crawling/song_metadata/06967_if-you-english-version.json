  "lyrics": "So now you're leaving my side And I can't do a thing to make you stay And love is saying goodbye And like a fool I blankly stand as you go by I'm watching him walk away, he's far away from here Memories are fading until he disappears Will this go away as time will pass me by? But I will remember you, Remember you If you If you Can we try this thing again one day? Can we try again if it is not too late? If you If you If you're struggling like I am I can make it easier yes I can Can we start all over again. Doesn't this hurt you at all? You don't feel the pain of loneliness? I guess you're glad that we're done But it's hard for me to just move on I can't forget I'm watching him walk away, he's far away from here Memories are fading until he disappears Will this go away as time will pass me by? But I will remember you, Remember you If you If you Can we try this thing again one day? Can we try again if it is not too late? If you If you If you're struggling like I am I can make it easier yes I can Can we start all over again. And when the rain falls on my face I look around and on those days I think of all the time I spent with you Our memories I'll hide them in a drawer And I'll take them out To remember all the things that we've been through Why didn't I know How much this would hurt To live without your love If you If you Can we try this thing again one day? Can we try again if it is not too late? If you If you If you're struggling like I am I can make it easier yes I can Can we start all over again. "
