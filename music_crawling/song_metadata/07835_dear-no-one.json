But sometimes, I just want somebody to hold Someone to give me their jacket when it's cold Got that young love even when we're old Yeah sometimes, I want someone to grab my hand Pick me up, pull me close, be my man I will love you till the end So if you're out there I swear to be good to you But I'm done lookin', for my future someone Cause when the time is right You'll be here, but for now Dear no one, this is your love song I don't really like big crowds I tend to shut people out I like my space, yeah But I'd love to have a soulmate And God'll give him to me someday And I know it'll be worth the wait, oh So if you're out there I swear to be good to you But I'm done lookin' (But I'm done lookin'), for my future someone Cause when the time is right You'll be here, but for now Dear no one (Dear nobody) this is your love song Sometimes, I just want somebody to hold Someone to give me their jacket when it's cold Got that young love even when we're old Yeah sometimes, I want someone to grab my hand Pick me up, pull me close, be my man I will love you till the end So if you're out there I swear to be good to you But I'm done lookin' (I'm done lookin'), for my future someone (Ooo-Yeah) Cause when the time is right You'll be here, but for now Dear no one (Dear Nobody) this is your love song (This is your love song) Dear no one, (ahahah...) No need to be searchin', Dear no one,... ohohoh... ohoh Dear no one,... whoa oh oh Dear no one, this is your love song"
