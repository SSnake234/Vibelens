  "lyrics": "A long long time ago There was a volcano Living all alone in the middle of the sea He sat high above on his bay Watching all the couples play And wishing that he had someone too And from his lava came this song of hope That he sang out loud Everyday for years and years I have a dream I hope will come true That you're here with me and I'm here with you I wish that the earth sea the sky up above Will send me someone to lava Years of singing all alone turned his lava into stone Until he was on the brink of extinction But little did he know that living in the sea below Another volcano was listening to his song Everyday she heard his tune her lava grew and grew Because she believed that someone's meant for her Now she was so ready to meet him above the sea As he sang his song of hope for the last time I have a dream I hope will come true That you're here with me and I'm here with you I wish that the earth sea the sky up above Will send me someone to lava Rising from the sea below stood a lovely volcano Looking all around but she could not see him He tried to sing to let her know That she was not there alone But with no lava his song was so gone He filled the sea with his tears And watched his dreams disappear As she remembered what his song meant to her I have a dream I hope will come true That you're here with me and I'm here with you I wish that the earth sea the sky up above Will send me someone to lava Oh they were so happy To finally meet above the sea All together now their lava grew and grew The longer are they all alone with aloha as their new home And when you visit them this is what they sing I have a dream I hope will come true That you'll grow old with me and I'll grow old with you We thank the earth sea the sky we've been to"
