  "lyrics": "  I heard that you're settled down That you found a girl And you're married now I heard that your dreams came true Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you Old friend why are you so shy It ain't like you to hold back Or hide from life I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I'd hoped you'd see my face And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you too Don't forget me I beg I re-member you said Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts in-stead Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah You'd know how time flies Only yesterday was the time of our lives We were born and raised In a summer haze Bound by the surprise of our glory days I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it I'd hoped you'd see my face And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you too Don't forget me I beg I re-member you said Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts in-stead, yeah Nothing compares no worries or cares Regrets and mistakes their memories make Who would have known how Bitter-sweet this would taste Never mind I’ll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you too Don't forget me I beg I re-member you said Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts in-stead Never mind I’ll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you too Don't forget me I beg I re-member you said Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts in-stead Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts in-stead Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead"
