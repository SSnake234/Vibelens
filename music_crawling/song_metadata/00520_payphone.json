And then that time that you wasted All of our bridges burnt down I've wasted my nights You turned out the lights Now I'm paralyzed Still stucked in that time when we called it l ove But even the sun sets in paradise I'm at a payphone trying to call home All of my change I've spent on you Where are the times gone baby It's all wrong, we're at the place we made for two If happy ever after did exist I would still be holding you like this And all those fairytales are full of it One more stupid love song I'll be safe You turned back on tomorrow Cause you forgot yesterday I gave you my love to borrow But just gave it away You can't expect me to be a fine I don't expect you to care I know I said it before But all of our bridges burnt down I've wasted my nights You turned out the lights Now I'm paralyzed Still stucked in that time when we called it love But even the sun sets in paradise I'm at a payphone trying to call home All of my change I've spent on you Where are the times gone baby It's all wrong, we're at the place we made for two If happy ever after did exist I would still be holding you like this And all those fairytales are full of it One more stupid love song I'll be safe Now I'm at a payphone… "
