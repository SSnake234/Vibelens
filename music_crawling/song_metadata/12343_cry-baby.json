  "lyrics": "You seem to replace Your brain with your heart You take things so hard And then you fall apart You try to explain But before you can start Those cry baby tears Come out of the dark Someone's turning the handle To that faucet in your eyes They're pouring out Where everyone can see Your heart's too big for your body It's where your feelings hide They're pouring out Where everyone can see They call you cry baby, cry baby But you don't fucking care Cry baby, cry baby So you laugh through your tears Cry baby, cry baby Cause you don't fucking care Tears fall to the ground You just let them drown  You're all on your own and You lost all your friends You told yourself that It's not you, it's them You're one of a kind And no one understands But those cry baby tears Keep coming back again Someone's turning the handle To that faucet in your eyes They're pouring out Where everyone can see Your heart's too big for your body It's where your feelings hide They're pouring out Where everyone can see They call you cry baby, cry baby But you don't fucking care Cry baby, cry baby So you laugh through your tears Cry baby, cry baby Cause you don't fucking care Tears fall to the ground You just let them drown I look at you and I see myself I know you better than anyone else I have the same faucet in my eyes So your tears are mine They call me cry baby, cry baby But I don't fucking care Cry baby, cry baby I laugh through my tears Cry baby, cry baby Cause I don't fucking care Tears fall to the ground I just let them drown"
