  "lyrics": "Please could you be tender and I will sit close to you Let's give it a minute before we admit that we're through Guess this is the winter, our bodies are young and blue I'm at Jungle City, it's late and this song is for you Cause I remember the rush, when forever was us Before all of the winds of regret and mistrust Now we sit in your car and our love is a ghost Well I guess I should go, yeah I guess I should go These are what they call hard feelings of love When sweet words and fevers all leave us right here in the cold, oh oh Alone with the hard feelings of love God I wish I believed you when you told me this was my home, oh oh I light all the candles, cut flowers for all my rooms I care for myself the way I used to care about you These days, we kiss and we keep busy, the waves come after midnight I call from underwater, why even try to get right? When you've outgrown a lover, the whole world knows but you It's time to let go of this endless summer afternoon These are what they call hard feelings of love When sweet words and fevers all leave us right here in the cold, oh oh Alone with the hard feelings of love God I wish I believed you when you told me this was my home, oh oh       Three years, loved you every single day, made me weak, it was real for me, yup, real for me Now I'll fake it every single day 'til I don't need fantasy, 'til I feel you leave But I still remember everything, how we'd drift buying groceries, how you'd dance for me I'll start letting go of little things 'til I'm so far away from you, far away from you, yeah Bet you wanna rip my heart out Bet you wanna skip my calls now Well guess what, I like that 'Cause I'm gonna mess your life up Gonna wanna tape my mouth shut Look out, lovers We're l-o-v-e-l-e-s-s generation L-o-v-e l-e-s-s generation All fuckin' with our lover's heads, gener ation"
