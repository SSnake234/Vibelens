I’m fall- in' In all the good times I find my self longin' for change And in the bad times I feel my self    Tell me some thing b oy... Aren’t you tired trying fill that void Or do you need more? Ain’t it hard keeping it so hard core I’m fall- ing In all the good times I find my self longin' for change And in the bad times I feel my self I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in I’ll never m eet the g round Crash through the surface, where they can’t hurt us We’re far from the shallow now In the shallow, shallow In the shallow, shal low In the shallow, shallow We’re far from the shallow now  Wooaa aah Woaaaa aaaaaa aaaaaa aaaaa aahhhhh"
