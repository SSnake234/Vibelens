Gave you up 'bout 21 times Felt those lips, tell me 21 lies, yeah You'll be the death of me Sage advice Love-lovin' you could make Jesus cry When I hear you're sayin' \"Darling, Your kiss is like an antidote.\" I'm fightin' like I'm Ali, But you got me on the ropes I never needed you like I do right now I never needed you like I do right now I never hated you like I do right now 'Cause all you ever do is make me... Couldn't hear the thunder But I heard your heart race Couldn't see the rain We're too busy makin' hurricanes, yeah Love ain't easy when it ain't my way But it gets hard, when you ain't here makin' me crazy Baby, say the word, darlin' You know just how to hold the sucker down So I see you in the morning I can't watch you walk out I never needed you like I do right now I never needed you like I do right now I never hated you like I do right now 'Cause all you ever do is make me... Cry Cry Hear the thunder See the rain  Yeah Keep on makin' me cry Hey, hey, yeah  Keep on makin' me cry Hey, hey, yeah I never needed you like I do right now I never needed you like I do right now I never hated you like I do right now 'Cause all you ever do is make me..."
