When I return, I wanna see This beautiful baby who's still loving me With tears in her eyes but a smile on her face Impatiently we'll embrace But it's not long now Till' I'm on my way I keep praying tomorrow was yesterday You're my everything that won't disappear Girl you've got nothing to fear If you're alone, I want you to know I'll be back someday Don't you ever let go Baby, hold tight through the cold lonely night Just wait for me till I get home When you're on your own I want you to know I'll be there for you, I could never let go I realise that you want me to stay But hold on I'll be back someday Be back someday, someday. If you're alone, I want you to know I'll be back someday Don't you ever let go Baby, hold tight through the cold lonely night Just wait for me till I get home When you're on your own I want you to know I'll be there for you, I could never let go I realise that you want me to stay But hold on I'll be back someday Be back someday, someday."
