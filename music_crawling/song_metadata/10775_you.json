  "lyrics": "Way beyond the stars was a dream there wai ting For a dreamer to dream her Barely just a spark in the open darkness of the ether The world be neath her I never could i magine How my life would change the day you came And how all my fears and worries would just wash away I never saw it coming, then one day all of a sudden There was you, you, you, you I don't have to live with out you any more How could it be so, that a heartless fool Could burst wide open, be re-a woken? Little did I know, what a simple thought could set in motion A drop in the ocean I've never seen the flowers or a sky so blue, it's all brand new Like the sun on the ho rizon coming into view I spent my whole life running, then one day all of a sudden There was you, you, you, you There was you, you, you, you I don't have to live with out you any more There was you, you, you, you There was you, you, you, you I don't have to live with out you any more I don't have to live with out you any more"
