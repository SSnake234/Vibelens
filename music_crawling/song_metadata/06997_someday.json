Right now, I know you can tell I'm down and I'm not doing well But one day these tears they will all run dry I won't have to cry sweet goodbye Chorus Cause someday. someone's gonna love me The way, I wanted you to need me Someday, someone's gonna take your place One day, I'll forget about you You'll see, I won't even miss you Someday, I know someone's gonna be there Cause someday. someone's gonna love me The way, I wanted you to need me Someday, someone's gonna take your place One day, I'll forget about you You'll see, I won't even miss you Someday, someday..."
