We made a promise to never get old .. ... You had a chance and you took it on me ... ... And I made a promise that I couldn't keep.. .. .. Heartache, heartbreaks All over town But something flipped like a switch When you came around And I'm in pieces Pick me up and put me together .. .. These are the days We've been waiting for On days like these Who could ask for more? Keep on coming Cause we're not done yet These are the days We won't regret These are the days We won't forget These are the days We've been waiting for Rattle the cage And slam that door And the world is calling us But not just yet These are the days We won't regret These are the days We won't forget Interlude:   Out on the midnight, the wild ones howl ... ... Last of the lost boys have thrown in the towel ... ... We used to believe we were stars aligned ... ... You made a wish and I fell out of Time flew, cut through All over town You made me bleed when I look up And you're not around But I'm in pieces Pick me up and put me together ... These are the days We've been waiting for On days like these Who could ask for more? Keep on coming Cause we're not done yet These are the days We won't regret These are the days We won't forget These are the days We've been waiting for Neither of us Knows what's in store You just pull your window down And place your bets These are the days We won't regret These are the days, we'll never forget And these are the days (these are the days) .. .. .. And these are the days (these are the days) .. .. .."
