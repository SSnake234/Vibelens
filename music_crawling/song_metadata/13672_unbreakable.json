  "lyrics": " Took my hand Touched my heart Held me close You were al ways there By my side Night and day Through it all Maybe come what may Swept a way on a wave of e motion Over caught in the eye of the storm And when ever you smile I can hardly believe that you're mine Believe that you're mine This love is un breakable It's unmis takeable And each time I look in your eyes I know why This love is un touchable I feel that my heart just can't deny Each time I look in your eyes Oh baby , I know why This love is un breakable Shared the laughter Shared the tears We both know We'll go on from here Cause to gether we are strong In my arms That's where you be long I've been touched by the hands of an angel I've been blessed by the power of love And when ever you smile I can hardly believe that you're mine This love is un breakable It's unmis takeable And each time I look in your eyes I know why This love is un touchable I feel that my heart just can't deny Each time you whisper my name Oh baby , I know why This love is un breakable Through fire and flame When all this over Our love still re mains This love is un breakable It's unmis takeable And each time I look in your eyes I know why This love is un touchable I feel that my heart just can't deny Each time you whisper my name Oh baby , I know why Cause each time I look in your eyes Oh baby , I know why This love is unbreakable Anh cảm nhận được rằng con tim mình không thể phủ nhận Anh cảm nhận được rằng con tim mình không thể phủ nhận Anh cảm nhận được rằng con tim mình không thể phủ nhận"
