So much for a happy ever It's never ending With me nothing but fate that has remained I'm suffocating in vain And it's you I tried to escape Once again I'm swept away So much for a happy ever It's never ending With you this story will never finish I can't forget it, I can't erase it I'm trapped within your eye The curse of loving you for life Back that night When we first met you were so beautiful True happiness in the whole world is you But somehow it went wrong You started changing it all I wish you hadn't so we could be home Tryna save my reflection in your eyes I don't think I can pierce through you and fly Maybe the old me could At least she understood And was just brave enough to face the truth But you surround me, all around me Pouring down until I'm drenched You fall as rain that are like prison bars You've closed up my heart so far So much for a happy ever It's never ending With me nothing but fate that has remained I'm suffocating in vain And it's you I tried to escape Once again I'm swept away So much for a happy ever It's never ending With you this story will never finish I can't forget it, I can't erase it I'm trapped within your eye The curse of loving you for life Back that night"
