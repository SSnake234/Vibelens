Tell me why You’re so hard to forget Don’t remind me I’m not over it Tell me why I can’t seem to face the truth I’m just a little too not over you Tell me why You’re so hard to forget Don’t remind me I’m not over it Tell me why  I can’t seem to face the truth I’m just a little too not over you You’re so hard to forget Don’t remind me I’m not over it Tell me why I can’t seem to face the truth I’m just a little too not over you Tell me why You’re so hard to forget Don’t remind me I’m not over it Tell me why I can’t seem to face the truth I’m just a little too not over you"
